self_loop_proportion,edge,A self-loop is defined as an edge from node u to node v where u equals v.
circuity_avg,edge,Sum of edge lengths divided by the sum of straight-line distances between edge endpoints
intersection_count,node,total nodes divided by total intersections
intersection_density_km,node,nodes divided by intersections per km
