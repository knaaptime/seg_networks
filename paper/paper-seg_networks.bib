  abstract = {This analysis uses census tract data to measure the segregation of the poor in U.S. metropolitan areas in 1970, 1980, and 1990. Two measures of segrega- tion are used: the indices of dissimilarity and isolation. In 1990 the mean dissimilarity of the poor in the 100 largest U.S. metropoli- tan areas was 36.1, which is substantial but below the 60.6 dissimilarity of blacks. The 1990 isolation of the poor was 21.0. From 1970 to 1990, the dissimilarity of the poor increased by 11 percent, and the isolation of the poor rose by 9 percent; in contrast, racial segregation declined. Exploratory regression analyses reveal that income segregation in metropolitan areas was significantly greater in 1990 and increased more from 1970 to 1990 in the Northeast than in the South and West. Midwest areas generally were not significantly different from Northeast areas in 1990 segregation levels or in changes from 1970 to 1990. Introduction},

We analyze the 100 most-populous commuting zones (CZs, which correspond generally with metropolitan areas) from 1990 to 2010 and consider five CZ-level outcomes: median household income, per capita income, proportion of residents ages 25 and older with bachelor's degrees, life expectancy, and homicide rate. If higher levels of segregation are associated with worse CZ outcomes, efforts to reduce economic and residential segregation could benefit all residents across metropolitan areas. We find that higher levels of economic segregation are associated with lower incomes, particularly for black residents. Further, higher levels of racial segregation are associated with lower incomes for blacks, lower educational attainment for whites and blacks, and lower levels of safety for all area residents.\textbackslash r\textbackslash nWe use our research on the 100 most-populous CZs to assess how racial and economic segregation contribute to quality-of-life outcomes in the Chicago metropolitan area. Challenges in Chicago\textemdash from depopulation to rising homicides\textemdash indicate a need to focus on segregation's effects on the region's prosperity. The Chicago case also illustrates the cost of segregation and provides a model for conducting similar cost estimates in other regions. Our research on 100 CZs and the Chicago metro area produced three major findings:\textbackslash r\textbackslash n The nation is changing in its spatial patterns, but remains starkly segregated by race and income.\textbackslash r\textbackslash n There is a real cost to segregation, which varies by race and ethnicity.\textbackslash r\textbackslash n Chicago continues to struggle as a highly segregated metro area, which has major effects for all residents.},

The analyses are developed from two complementary theoretical models - spatial assimilation and place stratification - and applied to the suburban communities of the nation's largest metropolitan regions, surrounding New York City, as of 1980. Proximity to non-Hispanic whites is very different for members of the white and black groups and little affected by their individual characteristics other than race.

But their neighborhoods are not the same as those of whites having the same socioeconomic characteristics; and, in particular, middle-class blacks tend to live with white neighbors who are less affluent than they are.

  abstract = {The article aims to make a methodological contribution to the education segregation literature, providing a critique of previous measures of segregation used in the literature, as well as suggesting an alternative approach to measuring segregation. Specifically, the paper examines Gorard, Fitz and Taylor's finding that social segregation between schools, as measured by free school meals (FSM) entitlement, fell significantly in the years following the 1988 Education Reform Act. Using Annual Schools Census data from 1989 to 2004, the paper challenges the magnitude of their findings, suggesting that the method used by Gorard et al. seriously overstates the size of the fall in segregation. We make the case for a segregation curve approach to measuring segregation, where comparisons of the level of segregation are possible regardless of the percentage FSM eligibility. Using this approach, we develop a new method for describing both the level and the location of school segregation.}

  abstract = {The most widely used measure of segregation is the so-called dissimilarity index. It is now well understood that this measure also reflects randomness in the allocation of individuals to units (i.e. it measures deviations from evenness, not deviations from randomness). This leads to potentially large values of the segregation index when unit sizes and/or minority proportions are small, even if there is no underlying systematic segregation. Our response to this is to produce adjustments to the index, based on an underlying statistical model. We specify the assignment problem in a very general way, with differences in conditional assignment probabilities underlying the resulting segregation. From this, we derive a likelihood ratio test for the presence of any systematic segregation, and bias adjustments to the dissimilarity index. We further develop the asymptotic distribution theory for testing hypotheses concerning the magnitude of the segregation index and show that the use of bootstrap methods can improve the size and power properties of test procedures considerably. We illustrate these methods by comparing dissimilarity indices across school districts in England to measure social segregation.},

New waves of international migration have initiated a process of ethnic and racial desegregation in many cities, and social class desegregation has been halted by growing economic inequality, the financial crisis, and the housing crash. Civil rights and social justice movements have historically contributed to shaping policies for desegregation, especially in city planning, housing, and education. Redistributive welfare policies are more efficient for addressing the structural forms of segregation, and local development policies, urban renewal, targeted housing, and mixing are considered more efficient than residential mobility and population reallocation.},

This paper presents a trade-theoretic model, with three regions (downtown, suburbia and the rest of the world), four goods (a tradable home good, untraded services, a tradable foreign good and land), and two factors (skilled and unskilled workers). Blacks are constrained to live downtown but by incurring commuting costs can work in suburbia. Several exogenous changes are considered (for example a fall in transport costs between suburbia and the rest of the world) which may lead simultaneously to a fall in the downtown unskilled wage and to job suburbanisation, and which therefore provide a theoretical basis for the hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Cultural diversity is a complex and multi-faceted concept. Commonly used quantitative measures of the spatial distribution of culturally defined groups\textemdash such as segregation, isolation or concentration indexes\textemdash have been designed to capture just one feature of this distribution. The strengths and weaknesses of such measures under varying demographic, geographic and behavioral conditions can only be comprehensively assessed empirically. This has been rarely done in the case of multigroup cultural diversity. This paper aims to fill this gap and to provide evidence on the empirical properties of various segregation indexes by means of Monte Carlo replications of agent-based modelling simulations under widely varying assumptions. Schelling's classical segregation model is used as the theoretical engine to generate patterns of spatial clustering. The data inputs include the initial population, the assumed geography, the number and shares of various cultural groups, and their preferences with respect to co-location. Our Monte Carlo replications of agent-based modelling data generating process produces output maps that enable us to assess the sensitivity of the various measures of segregation to parameter assumptions by means of response surface analysis. We find that, as our simulated city becomes more diverse, stable residential location equilibria require the preference for co-location with one's own group to be not much more than the group share of the smallest demographic minority. When equilibria exist, the values of the various segregation measures are strongly dependent on the composition of the population across cultural groups, the assumed preferences and the assumed geography. Index values are generally non-decreasing in increasing preference for within-group co-location. More diverse populations yield\textemdash for given preferences and geography\textemdash a greater degree of spatial clustering. The sensitivity of segregation measures to underlying conditions suggests that meaningful analysis of the impact of segregation requires spatial panel data modelling.},

  abstract = {Segregation studies have mainly focused on urban structures as a whole or have discussed specific (gentrifying or renewing) neighbourhoods. The literature suggests that changes in segregation occur primarily through selective migration. In this paper, we follow up on recent work that has questioned these orthodoxies, suggesting that in situ social mobility, and entries to and exits from the city population should be taken into account as well, and that dynamics in all neighbourhoods should be considered. The paper traces the processes by which segregation changes for the cities of Amsterdam and The Hague for 1999\textendash 2006, using a longitudinal individual-level database covering the entire population. It extends previous work by looking at income rather than socio-economic status and by drilling down to the neighbourhood level. Applying an existing measure of segregation (Delta) in a novel way, the analysis focuses on changes in the spatial distribution of household income, measuring the relative contribution of a range of processes to changes in segregation. Results show that segregation rises in both cities but that different processes drive changes in each case. Furthermore, the aggregate change in segregation for each city masks a diversity of changes at the neighbourhood level, some of which tend to increase segregation while others tend to reduce it. Mapping these changes and the individual processes contributing to them shows that they have a distinct geography, which seems to be structured by historically specific trends in state and housing market context. \textcopyright{} 2016 The Authors.

The layering of data (housing covenants, demographic data, historic maps) reveals the relationship of these mechanisms-specifically racial covenants and federal government ``redlining'' maps-to current inequality and segregation. These projects not only serve to increase the transparency of private and governmental housing policies that have served to racially segregate American cities but also demonstrate how historic data, provided openly to the public, can inform contemporary discussions around equitable urban development.},

Such a conclusion is important from an urban planning perspective as it suggests that only a very restricted range of possible actions, if any, would be able to contribute to limiting social segregation, unless individual preferences are significantly modified. My own simulations show that, using appropriate graph-based spatial structures, one can reveal significant spatial effects and thus provide alternative planning insights. Cliques in networks indeed play a significant role, reinforcing segregation effects in Schelling's model. Introducing a small amount of noise into the model permits us to reveal this effect more precisely, without modifying the global behavior of the initial model. Furthermore, I show how a logistic model describes in a concise but precise way this global behavior at an aggregated level. \textcopyright{} 2012 Pion Ltd and its Licensors.},

  abstract = {There has been extensive use of segregation indices for measuring residential segregation since 1950s, with continuous progress made in the field. Recent developments include the propositions of spatial global and local versions of traditionally used segregation indices, which have opened avenues for representing and analysing segregation as a multiscale and spatially varying phenomenon. Much less explored has been the issue of how important research design choices, such as the extent of geographical boundaries, grouping systems and scales of analysis, can influence the measurement of segregation. This paper contributes in this direction by investigating the impact of such decisions in the outcomes of the indices of generalized dissimilarity (D) and information theory (H) using a set of sensitivity analysis. Using a comparative study between London and S\~ao Paulo as basis, results obtained with different geographical boundaries, grouping systems and scales for the two indices are analysed visually and quantitatively. Results suggest that although D and H depict the same spatial dimension of segregation (unevenness/clustering), they present different sensitivity to geographical boundaries and grouping systems. The study also revealed how the two indices unfold different aspects of the segregation, which impact on their interpretation and applicability. The study concludes with a discussion of the considerations on research design choices concerning the interpretation of the results, which indicate the two indices should not be used interchangeably.},

Typically, urban areas are less than fully stratified, and the question arises, how much do departures from standard Tiebout assumptions contribute to observed within-neighborhood mixing? This paper quantifies the separate effects of employment geography (via costly commuting) and preferences for housing attributes on neighborhood stratification. It does so using an equilibrium sorting model, estimated with rich Census micro-data. Simulations based on the model and credible preference estimates show that counterfactual reductions in commuting costs lead to marked increases in racial and education segregation and, to a lesser degree, increases in income segregation, given that households now find it easier to locate in neighborhoods with like households. While turning off preferences for housing characteristics increases racial segregation, especially for blacks, doing so reduces income segregation, indicating that heterogeneity in the housing stock serves to stratify households based on ability-to-pay. Further, we show that differences in housing help to accentuate differences in the consumption of local amenities.},

  abstract = {Socio-spatial segregation has been recognised as an important factor affecting school segregation and educational attainment in urban schools. As urban populations grow and socio-spatial segregation has become a pressing issue in many contexts, a more sophisticated understanding of the interconnections between spatial and school segregation is needed, including the role of school catchment areas as a possible mediating factor. In our article, we focus on the two-way relationship between urban residential mobility and catchment area segregation in Helsinki, Finland. Using fine-grain statistical data we analyse how the long-term changes in spatial segregation have changed catchment area populations and how residential mobility of families with children is, in turn, related to catchment area composition. The analysis focuses on the majority population whose residential choices typically have the strongest impact on segregation patterns in cities. Our main finding is that there is a systematic relationship between socio-spatial segregation and catchment area differentiation, where the disadvantaged areas are consistently left behind in the general socio-economic development. Even though the institutional school quality is high throughout the city, the residential choices of families with children feed into the self-perpetuating cycles of segregation, as the most disadvantaged areas are rejected and privileged areas favoured in mobility patterns. The results highlight the need for urban educational policies with a high sensitivity to the persistent socio-spatial inequalities shaping educational opportunities.},

Distortion coefficients are derived from trajectories of contact with the city's population as an individual will encounter an increasing number of persons in a growing distance from their original location. They can be interpreted as measures of how different, or in technical terms, how distorted the view of the city is from any one location. In this paper, we present the theoretical rationale and the procedure leading to the computation of the Distortion coefficients. Through a detailed illustration using Chicago as a case study, we provide the general framework for analyzing and visualizing Distortion. We show that these measures are able to capture complex demographic changes over time and paint a more complete picture of segregation than indices based on imposed scales.}

Here we find clear evidence that income segregation has grown rapidly, particularly in the last decade and particularly among black and Hispanic families. Third, we describe the variation in income segregation among the 117 metropolitan areas with populations of at least 500,000 in 2009. We document considerable variation in income segregation among metropolitan areas - a variation systematically related to several key features of metropolitan areas, including their size, level of income inequality, age composition, and average educational levels. Fourth, we investigate the metropolitan area correlates of changes in income segregation, investigating whether changes in these characteristics over time are systematically related to changes in income segregation levels. Again, we find that segregation has grown most rapidly in metropolitan areas characterized by growing income inequality, growing proportions of children, and increasing average educational attainment levels. The longitudinal analyses also show that changes in unemployment and manufacturing jobs are inversely related to income segregation.},

However, its dynamics are complex and often difficult to understand. This paper presents an agent-based model (ABM) of urban settlement, agglomeration, displacement, and sprawl. New human settlements form around a natural amenity that draws initial, poor settlers to subsist on the resource. As the settlement grows, subsequent settlers of varying income, skills, and interests are heterogeneously drawn to either 1) the natural amenity or 2) the emerging human agglomeration. As the agglomeration grows and densifies, land values increase, and the initial poor settlers may be displaced away from the natural amenity on which they relied. Through path dependence, high-income residents remain clustered around this natural amenity for which they have no direct use or interest. The agent-based model presented here explores the dynamics of this process. In particular, it reveals how urban displacement and gentrification can be sensitive to income inequality, density, and varied preferences for different types of spatial amenities.},

These models are commonly defined as planar, meaning they can be represented in two dimensions without any underpasses or overpasses. However, real-world urban street networks exist in three-dimensional space and frequently feature grade separation such as bridges and tunnels: planar simplifications can be useful but they also impact the results of real-world street network analysis. This study measures the nonplanarity of drivable and walkable street networks in the centers of 50 cities worldwide, then examines the variation of nonplanarity across a single city. It develops two new indicators - the Spatial Planarity Ratio and the Edge Length Ratio - to measure planarity and describe infrastructure and urbanization. While some street networks are approximately planar, we empirically quantify how planar models can inconsistently but drastically misrepresent intersection density, street lengths, routing, and connectivity.},

The results confirm that residential segregation and educational segregation are two interrelated phenomena in Barcelona.

  abstract = {Social and social-spatial inequality are on the rise in the Global North. This has resulted in increasing segmentation between population groups with different social and ethnic backgrounds, and in differentiated access to cultural and material assets. With these changes, the relation between segregation in the educational sphere and segregation in the residential sphere has become crucial for understanding social reproduction and intergenerational social mobility. However, knowledge about this relation is still limited. We argue that the institutional and spatial contexts are key dimensions to consider if we want to expand this knowledge. The institutional context regards the extent of public funding, the degree to which parental choice and/or geographical proximity drive school selection, the role and status of private schools and the religious and pedagogical pluralism of the educational system. The spatial context refers to the geographies of education: the ethnic and social composition of school populations and their reputations; the underlying levels and trends of residential segregation; and the spatial distribution of schools in urban space. In this introduction to the special issue we will address these interrelated dimensions, with reference to theoretical and empirical contributions from the existing body of literature; and with reference to the contributions in this special issue. School segregation emerges from the studies included in this special issue as a relevant issue, differently framed according to the institutional and spatial contexts. A comparative typology will be proposed to illustrate how school segregation is peculiarly shaped in different national and local contexts.},

We find that segregation based on income is relatively moderate but segregation on the basis of migration background and educational attainment level is relatively high. Multinomial regression models show that different class fractions are oriented to very different residential milieus.

We find that blacks substitute towards postal work as other employment opportunities leave the city circa 1960. The response is particularly strong in segregated areas, where black neighborhoods are clustered near the central business district. Furthermore, this pattern only holds for non-mail carriers, many of whom work in central processing facilities. More recently, the relationship between black postal employment and segregation has declined, suggesting that spatial mismatch has become less important over time. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Our results corroborate other studies that observed rising economic segregation from 1970 to 1990, followed by a substantial decline in the 1990s to approximately 1970 levels. We find the rich and the poor moderately segregated from the nonrich and the nonpoor, while highly segregated from each other. The segregation manifests itself in growing concentrations of the poor in the central cities and emigration of the middle class and the wealthy to the suburbs and beyond. When the poor population is disaggregated by race, our results indicate the highest level of segregation continues to be experienced by poor Blacks.

We use administrative records from Baltimore City and suburban Baltimore County public elementary schools (2011 to 2015) to generate a network of schools based on student transfers. We then apply repeated calculations of the Louvian method of community detection to estimate emergent sets of schools that similar parents are likely to consider\textemdash which we term emergent consideration sets\textemdash and use gravity models to explore the role of social structure, demographics, and geography in observed enrollment patterns. We find that our network-derived emergent consideration sets are better defined by structural boundaries than by student composition or proficiency alone. Within consideration sets, students tend to avoid schools with relatively higher levels of free- and reduced-price meal eligibility and flock toward schools with higher proficiency levels. School racial composition, however, plays a much smaller role in predicting movement between schools, in part because structural constraints generate racially homogeneous consideration sets. Together, these findings highlight how regional social and geographic organization shapes school segregation processes and the policies used to combat them.},

Results suggest that the degree of social segregation within education systems varied substantially across countries. Furthermore, multilevel regression models indicate that the effect of socioeconomic status on student achievement was moderately but significantly stronger in more segregated education systems, even after controlling for alternative system-level determinants of social inequality in student achievement. These findings provide original evidence that social segregation in education systems may contribute to the intergenerational transmission of educational (dis)advantage and thus serve to exacerbate wider problems of socioeconomic inequality in Europe.},

  abstract = {Racial segregation is often blamed for some of the achievement gap between blacks and whites. We study the effects of school and neighborhood segregation on the relative SAT scores of black students across different metropolitan areas, using large microdata samples for the 1998-2001 test cohorts. Our models include detailed controls for the family background of individual test-takers, school-level controls for selective participation in the test, and city-level controls for racial composition, income, and region. We find robust evidence that the black-white test score gap is higher in more segregated cities. Holding constant family background and other factors, a shift from a highly segregated city to a nearly integrated city closes about one-quarter of the raw black-white gap in SAT scores. Specifications that distinguish between school and neighborhood segregation suggest that neighborhood segregation has a consistently negative impact while school segregation has no independent effect, though we cannot reject equality of the two effects. Additional tests indicate that much of the effect of neighborhood segregation operates through neighbors' incomes, not through race per se. Data on enrollment in honors courses suggest that within-school segregation increases when schools are more highly integrated, potentially offsetting the benefits of school desegregation and accounting for our findings. \textcopyright{} 2007.},

  abstract = {In many cities, public housing has come to exemplify concentrated urban poverty and the social problems associated with it. One major policy response to addressing these problems is the demolition and redevelopment of public housing complexes as mixed-income communities. Several theoretical propositions that lie behind this policy are based on assumptions about the ways in which living among higher-income residents can lead to relationships and interactions that may benefit poor people. Based on in-depth qualitative research in two mixed-income developments in Chicago, this paper explores the dynamics of social interaction in an effort to better understand the processes and factors that influence such interaction on the ground, the differential experience of residents from different backgrounds, and the factors that contribute to their decision-making about and interpretation of social relations with their neighbors. This analysis helps to better interpret the findings of earlier studies and craft more informed expectations about such interactions and their likely effects. Overthepasttwodecades,catalyzedmostnotablybythepublicationofWilliamJuliusWilson's seminal 1987 book The Truly Disadvantaged, there has been renewed scholarly interest in urban poverty and, particularly, the problems associated with concentrated urban poverty\textemdash how living in high-poverty areas multiplies the deleterious effects of being poor\textemdash as well as appropriate policy responses to address these problems. The case of public housing is emblematic. Although initially established to provide reasonable, transitional housing to poor individuals and families (Bowly, 1978), by the 1980s public housing in many cities came to exemplify concentrated urban poverty and the social problems associated with it\textemdash high levels of crime and violence, deteriorating housing and physical infrastructure, weak institutions, poor services, social isolation, racial segregation, joblessness, and welfare " dependency " among them. The recognition of these problems led, among other responses, to two major policy directions in the United States. The first is dispersal policies, which range from the development of scattered-site public housing buildings to the provision of housing vouchers to targeted efforts to relocate},

In the first part, we present quasi-experimental evidence that neighborhoods affect intergenerational mobility through childhood exposure effects. In partic-ular, the outcomes of children whose families move to a better neighborhood \textendash{} as measured by the outcomes of children already living there \textendash{} improve linearly in proportion to the time they spend growing up in that area. We distinguish the causal effects of neighborhoods from con-founding factors by comparing the outcomes of siblings within families, studying moves triggered by displacement shocks, and exploiting sharp variation in predicted place effects across birth cohorts, genders, and quantiles. We also document analogous childhood exposure e{$\carriagereturn$}ects for college attendance, teenage birth rates, and marriage rates. In the second part of the paper, we identify the causal effect of growing up in every county in the U.S. by estimating a fixed effects model identified from families who move across counties with children of di{$\carriagereturn$}erent ages. We use these estimates to decompose observed intergenerational mobility into a causal and sorting com-ponent in each county. For children growing up in families at the 25th percentile of the income distribution, each year of childhood exposure to a one standard deviation (SD) better county increases income in adulthood by 0.5\%. Hence, growing up in a one SD better county from birth increases a child's income by approximately 10\%. Low-income children are most likely to succeed in counties that have less concentrated poverty, less income inequality, better schools, a larger share of two-parent families, and lower crime rates. Boys' outcomes vary more across areas than girls, and boys have especially poor outcomes in highly-segregated areas. In urban areas, better areas have higher house prices, but our analysis uncovers significant variation in neighborhood quality even conditional on prices.}

Modeling the structure and dynamics of segregation is a pressing problem for sociology and urban planning, but existing methods have limitations. In this paper, we develop a suite of methods, grounded in information theory, for studying the spatial structure of segregation. We first advance existing profile and decomposition methods by posing two related regionalization methods, which allow for profile curves with nonconstant spatial scale and decomposition analysis with nonarbitrary areal units. We then formulate a measure of local spatial scale, which may be used for both detailed, within-city analysis and intercity comparisons. These methods highlight detailed insights in the structure and dynamics of urban segregation that would be otherwise easy to miss or difficult to quantify. They are computationally efficient, applicable to a broad range of study questions, and freely available in open source software.},

  abstract = {Significant levels of separation between blacks and whites still exist in large American cities, and debate about the causes of that residential separation has been considerable. A balanced analysis of the factors that might explain residential segregation - economic status (affordability), social preferences, urban structure, and discrimination - suggests that no one factor can account for the patterns that have arisen in U.S. metropolitan areas. Empirical estimation of the impact of economic status suggests that 30-70 percent of racial separation is attributable to economic factors. However, economic factors do not act alone, but in association explanatory weight for present residential patterns. Survey evidence from both national and local studies shows that black households prefer neighborhoods that are half black and half white, while whites prefer neighborhoods ranging from 0 to 30 percent black. The debate about causes seems most polarized over the role of discrimination. Although comments in the literature often focus on the past use of racially restrictive covenants by state-regulated agencies and discriminatory acts by realtors and financial institutions, the documented individual cases of discrimination do not appear to be part of a massive collusion to deny housing opportunities to minorities. A review of the evidence from social science investigations demonstrates that there are multiple causes of racial residential separation in U.S. metropolitan areas. \textcopyright{} 1986 Martinus Nijhoff Publishers.},

  abstract = {Despite the intensity of the recent debate between Clark and Galster, there is consid-erable agreement that there are multiple forces which create the patterns of residential separation found in American cities, and that government of public discrimination plays a minor rote. The differences between Clark and Galster relate to the relative weight to be given to private discrimination and the role of preferences in explaining the patterns of racial separation. The actual weight to be given to private discrimination is yet to be specified. As I noted at the end of the last comment in this ongoing series on the role of the forces which can be used to explain the patterns of racial separation found in American cities, my reply was unlikely to end the debate and indeed it has not. Rather than take up more valuable journal space with additional "'posi-tion statements", I will emphasize the areas of commonality, reiterate the differences, and make some brief comments on those differences. In this review I want to focus on the main points of the debate and not become bogged down in refutations and counter charges -it is too easy to get lost in the forest. I have achieved my original aim of insisting on a balanced consideration of the four or five general factors which play a role in generating residential patterns in American cities. I have also achieved my aim of positioning the analysis of residential separation in the general context of the analysis of the residential mosaic. While Galster and I agree that affordability, job location, preferences, information, and private discrimination play a role in explaining patterns of racial separation, until recently not all scholars agreed. Indeed, in the initial paper I was at pains to point out, and cite, the works which placed all the weight on discrimination as the explanation for separation in the city. It was the Fair Housing Act which suggested that "black Americans form a racially different but otherwise socio-economically equal segment of our socie-ty and that the only factor keeping blacks imprisoned in their ghettos was pervasive white prejudice, discrimination and exclusion" (cited in Newman, 1986: 173). If nothing else we are agreed that this is a poor description of the process which has generated the complex mosaic of residential patterning in the American city. I wish to emphasize again that it was to redress the imbalance reflected in the above citation that the original paper was written. I},

  abstract = {Racism is a still a central topic in current debates about multiculturalism, but there is increasing evidence that appeals to racism\textemdash as the explanation for urban behaviors and the current patterns of residential separation\textemdash are overly simplistic. In a multi-ethnic/racial context in which groups have different agendas, it is no longer useful to cast societal divisions as issues of Black versus White. This is especially true for the residential mosaic. Survey responses from the Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality about racial attitudes reveal strongly held own-race preferences across quite different mixes of ethnic and racial groups. The evidence from the analysis reported in this paper suggests that these strongly held ethnocentric positions will continue to have important influences on the patterns of residential separation in urban areas. To argue that White preferences and White discrimination alone are the major forces in creating behaviors and patterns of separation in the urban fabric ignores the forces for separation, which are embedded in these ethnic differences and ethnocentrism more generally. The evidence from this study reaffirms the complex ethnocentric responses not only of Whites but also of other ethnic groups.},

Research in social science has provided a formal basis for the segregative outcomes resulting from the residential selection process and simulations have replicated relevant spatial outcomes under different specifications of the residential dynamics. New and increasingly detailed survey data on preferences demonstrates the embeddedness of the Schelling selection process in the social behaviors of choosing alternative residential compositions. It also demonstrates that, in the multicultural context, seemingly mild preferences for living with similar neighbors carry the potential to be strong determinants for own race selectivity and residential segregation.},

This study examines how residential preferences change across income, education, and age and provides new information on how race and socioeconomic status interact to create patterns of preference in particular locations. In general, African-Americans with increasing income show a distinct shift to greater willingness to live in integrated settings but also a distinct shift to own-race selections with second choices for neighborhood composition. Whites' unwillingness to move to African-American neighborhoods of more than 50\% other race exacerbates the tendency to separate. Socioeconomic status plays a similar role for other ethnic groups. These findings parallel those from agent-based modeling about the low probability of achieving substantial mixing of racial and ethnic groups.

The immigration flows of the past decade have substantially altered the ethnic mix and neighborhood mixing. In addition, multi-ethnic individuals themselves are altering the level of mixing among racial and ethnic groups. The research in this article shows that those who report themselves of more than one race have high levels of residential integration both in central cities and suburbs. These residential patterns can be interpreted as further evidence of tentative steps to a society in which race per se is less critical in residential patterning. The level of integration, for Asian mixed and black mixed is different and substantially higher than for those who report one race alone. The research in this article builds on previous aggregate studies of mixed-race individuals to show substantial patterns of integration in California's metropolitan areas.},

The changes are clearly context dependent but at the same time there are broad generalizations that arise from the processes of residential sorting and selection. A major question in U.S. segregation research is how the growth of Asian and Hispanic populations is influencing patterns of segre- gation and diversity at the neighborhood level. In this article we use a variant of a nearest neighbor approach to map, graph, and evaluate patterns of race and ethnicity at varying scales.We show that using a multiscalar approach to segregation can provide a detailed and more complete picture of segregation. The research con- firms work from other studies that segregation is decreasing between some groups and increasing between others, and the patterns, and processes can be described as dynamic diversity. In a series of maps of ethnic clus- ters and population homogeneity we show how metropolitan areas, represented in this case by Los Angeles, now display patterns of complex living arrangements with multiple groups inhabiting both local neighborhoods and wider community spheres.},

It then presents a detailed discussion of key studies of urban form and travel behavior. The research strategies employed and the data, methods, and results of these studies are evaluated in detail. The article concludes that although this body of research is improving in several respects and should be encouraged by policy makers and scholars alike, our current understanding of this complex group of relationships remains tentative. The basis for using land use and urban design to selectively change travel behavior thus appears limited in the near term, whereas research opportunities abound.}

An additional two models focused on minimizing the unevenness in congestion for ICU beds at hospitals. Results suggest that with respect to hospital beds, there was not much difference between racial groups in terms of supply accessibility, but there were greater differences in the travel cost for accessing those services. This is due to the association between the centrality dimension of residential segregation and the central location of hospitals in the Chicago Area. Results also suggest that the goal of even congestion levels results in higher travel costs with the region.},

  abstract = {Our essay begins from the premise that residential segregation by race remains a defining feature of most metropolitan areas and continues to exert strong and multifaceted im-pacts on the life chances of segregated populations. Despite declines in average levels of segregation and the increasing prevalence of multiethnic neighborhoods (Glaeser and Vigdor 2012), overall levels of segregation between black and white Americans remain high by most measures, and are especially pronounced in cities with the largest black pop-ulations (Massey and Tannen 2015; Massey 2015). Levels of segregation between Latinos and whites, and between Asians and whites, have changed very little in recent decades (Massey 2015). The consequences of this persistent segregation are vast and well documented. The central repercussion is that members of different racial and ethnic groups are still ex-posed, on average, to fundamentally unequal neighborhood environments. A huge body of research has linked this segregation to the persistence of profound racial differences in life chances as reflected in differential exposure to neighborhood poverty (Logan 2011), crime (Peterson and Krivo 2010), and pollution (Crowder and Downey 2010; Jones et al. 2014), access to educational and employment opportunities (De la Roca et al. 2014; Frankenberg 2013; Kneebone and Holmes 2015; Logan et al. 2012), and a wide range of individual outcomes, including earnings (Thomas and Moye 2015), wealth (Shapiro et al. 2013), and health (Kershaw and Albrecht 2015; Subramanian et al. 2005; White and Borrell 2011; Yang and Matthews 2015). These consequences of segregation extend well beyond those felt by segregated minorities. The more insidious effects of segregation are on the broader social, political, and economic health of the country, as evidenced most publicly in the ongoing unrest over police violence against people of color, the roots of which can be found in the profound racial injustices borne out of segregation and differ-ential opportunity structures. Yet, while evidence for the continuing salience of segregation is strong, our explana-tions for its persistence remain relatively weak. Our collective attempts to understand the root causes of segregation have fallen into a kind of intellectual malaise, characterized by the overly simplistic and completely automatic application of a few simple theoretical arguments. These arguments are incapable of explaining why segregation remains such 18 MOVING BEYOND THE BIG THREE a defining characteristic of most of our metropolitan areas, despite liberalizing racial at-titudes, reductions in the most overt forms of discrimination, economic advancement for some minority groups, and technological advances that should loosen the ties of neigh-borhood. Our explanations, in short, have become out-dated. In order to understand why segregation persists, then, we need to move in different directions theoretically and analytically. We must critically assess our current theoretical arguments, critique the as-sumptions underlying their application, consider factors not captured in these traditional arguments, and investigate ways to collect better data on the multifaceted factors that maintain residential stratification. Virtually all of the massive body of research on the patterns and drivers of segrega-tion relies on some combination of three dominant theories (Charles 2003). The first of these Big Three theoretical arguments focuses on racial differences in human capital and argues that higher levels of education, income, and wealth improve access to the most advantaged neighborhoods (Crowder et al. 2006; South and Crowder 1997) such that racial segregation arises from racial/ethnic differences in these resources. The sec-ond argument contends that residential segregation stems from racial/ethnic differences in residential preferences, with out-group avoidance or in-group affinity leading individ-uals to choose neighborhoods dominated by their own group (Charles 2006; Clark 2008; Krysan et al. 2009). Third, the place stratification perspective (Charles 2003; Logan and Molotch 1987) suggests that whites' aversion to sharing residential space with minor-ity neighbors reinforces discriminatory practices of real estate agents, landlords, mort-gage lenders, and neighbors (Roscigno et al. 2009; Ross and Turner 2005), which creates a racially-segmented housing market that produces disparate residential outcomes. In essence, the tendency is to assume that segregation comes about because members of different groups simply prefer different kinds of neighborhoods, some groups lack the resources needed to gain access to " better " neighborhoods, or discriminatory treatment in the housing market denies people the opportunity to live where they would like. There is ample research to suggest that the dynamics implicated in each of these Big Three theoretical arguments contribute to the maintenance of racial-residential strat-ification. However, the steadfast and exclusive reliance on these arguments and their somewhat simplistic application has hampered our ability to develop a stronger under-standing of the processes through which segregation is maintained and perpetuated. The way in which the field has relied on these dominant theories creates two core problems. First, the forces implicated in these theoretical arguments are often treated as compet-ing, mutually exclusive, and virtually exhaustive explanations of segregation, so much so that weak evidence in a study for one theory is interpreted as support for another of the theories. For example, if racial differences in the neighborhood attainment patterns that shape segregation persist after controls for group differences in socioeconomic condi-tions, the typical conclusion is that the remaining differences reflect some combination of discrimination and group differences in preferences (Crowder et al. 2006; Logan et al. 1996). This tendency to view existing arguments as competing and additive, of course, undermines any ability to recognize the ways in which preferences, discrimination, and economic forces interact and complement one another in the maintenance of residen-tial segregation, and closes off the assessment of more complex, but no less important, dynamics that maintain residential segregation. A second related problem is that implicit in the three dominant theories is the assump-tion that individuals possess accurate and complete information about the community 19}

  abstract = {Understanding segregation is essential to develop planning tools for building more inclusive cities. Theoretically, segregation at the work place has been described as lower compared to residential segregation given the importance of skill complementarity among other productive factors shaping the economies of cities. This paper tackles segregation during working hours from a dynamical perspective by focusing on the movement of urbanites across the city. In contrast to measuring residential patterns of segregation, we used mobile phone data to infer home-work trajectory net- works and apply a community detection algorithm to the example city of Santiago, Chile. We then describe qualitatively and quantitatively outlined communities, in terms of their socio eco- nomic composition. We then evaluate segregation for each of these communities as the probability that a person from a specific community will interact with a co-worker from the same commu- nity. Finally, we compare these results with simulations where a new work location is set for each real user, following the empirical probability distributions of home-work distances and angles of direction for each community. Methodologically, this study shows that segregation during working hours for Santiago is unexpectedly high for most of the city with the exception of its central and business district. In fact, the only community that is not statistically segregated corresponds to the downtown area of Santiago, described as a zone of encounter and integration across the city.},

By including multiple variables and a Composite Socioeconomic Index to characterise neighbourhoods, our approach provides a more realistic assessment of the differences blacks and whites experience in separate and unequal neighbourhoods, even though they may have similar incomes. Thus different neighbourhoods have different social and economic consequences for black and white residents.},

In this paper, Monte Carlo results suggest that bootstrapping a commonly used index of inequality leads to inference that is not accurate even in very large samples, although inference with poverty indices is satisfactory. We find that the major cause is the extreme sensitivity of many inequality indices to the exact nature of the upper tail of the income distribution. This leads us to study two non-standard bootstraps, the m out of n bootstrap, which is valid in some situations where the standard bootstrap fails, and a bootstrap in which the upper tail is modelled parametrically. Monte Carlo results suggest that accurate inference can be achieved with this last method in moderately large samples. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Despite decades of research into the underlying causes of black-white residential segregation, there is still much disagreement among scholars over the root causes of this phenomenon. This article examines recent evidence on the causes of black-white residential segregation. Evidence on the following hypotheses is examined: racial income differences, racial differences in tastes for housing services, racial differences in housing market information, racial prejudice, and housing market discrimination. Recent evidence suggests that household-level socioeconomic and demographic characteristics explain only a small proportion of the racial differences in location choices. Racial processes such as prejudice and housing market discrimination continue to drive black-white segregation patterns.},

As suggested by Tiebout [Tiebout, C., 1956. A pure theory of local public expenditures. Journal of Political Economy 64, 416-424.], fragmented local governance structures may encourage households to vote with their feet and sort into communities based on their willingness to pay for local public services. This outcome has been well documented. The nuance explored here is that, if the demand for local public services varies by race or if households have preferences for neighbors with specific racial characteristics, local government fragmentation may foster an increase in residential segregation by race across neighborhoods and jurisdictions. Results from metropolitan-level regressions suggest that increased Tiebout choice is associated with increases in black-white residential segregation within US metropolitan areas. Comparable results are obtained from household-level estimates, where the black racial composition of a household's census tract of residence is regressed on household-level controls and racially stratified measures of Tiebout choice. Results from both approaches suggest that a 10\% increase in Tiebout choice would increase neighborhood segregation by no more than 1\%, while segregation across jurisdictions would increase by between 4\% and 7\%. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

We calculate the extent of residential segregation across major US cities using data from the 2000 US Census. The correlation between the Spectral index and the commonly-used dissimilarity index is .42. Using detailed data on friendship networks, available in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we calculate the prevalence of within-school racial segregation. The results suggests that the percent of minority students within a school, commonly used as a substitute for a measure of in-school segregation, is a poor proxy for social interactions.},

  abstract = {An important topic in the study of segregation are comparisons across space and time. This article extends current approaches in segregation measurement by presenting a five-term decomposition procedure that can be used to understand more clearly why segregation has changed or differs between two comparison points. Two of the five terms account for differences in segregation that are due to the differing marginal distributions (e.g., the gender and occupational distributions), while one term accounts for differences in segregation due the different structure of segregation (what might be termed ``pure'' segregation). The decomposition thus presents a solution to the problem of margin dependency, frequently discussed in the segregation literature. Finally, two terms account for the appearance or disappearance of units when analyzing change over time. The method can be further extended to attribute structural changes to individual units, which makes it possible, for instance, to quantify the effect of each occupation on changing gender* segregation. The practical advantages of the decomposition are illustrated by two examples: a study of changing occupational gender segregation in the United States and a study of changing residential segregation in Brooklyn, New York.},

In this article, we explore changes in racial integration in recent decades using decennial census tract data from 1990, 2000, and 2010. We begin by examining changes in the prevalence of racially integrated neighborhoods and find that the share of metropolitan neighborhoods that are integrated increased significantly during this period, from slightly less than 20 percent to slightly more than 30 percent. We then shed light on the pathways through which these changes have occurred. We find both a small increase in the number of neighborhoods becoming integrated for the first time during this period and a more sizable increase in the share of integrated neighborhoods that remained integrated. Finally, we offer insights about which neighborhoods become integrated in the first place and which remain stably integrated over time.},

This loss was concentrated among the most segregated white tracts \textendash{} those with low diversity. White tracts that were moderately diverse actually doubled in number between 1990 and 2010 although this increase was insufficient to cancel the loss of low diversity white tracts. We model the effects of metropolitan characteristics on white-tract change by metropolitan area. Greater metropolitan-scale diversity increases the probability that low-diversity white tracts transition to moderate-diversity white. Moderately diverse white tracts, however, become more stable with increased diversity. A large metropolitan percentage of blacks or the foreign born reverses this stabilizing effect, increasing the probability that moderately diverse white tracts transition to non-white tracts. Overall, the results suggest a reconfiguration rather than a dissolving of white dominated neighborhood space in response to increased metropol...},

As such, segregation has been a subject of long-standing interest. However, segregation has not been assigned in randomized controlled trials, so the observed correlations may be spurious and the mechanism behind these correlations is poorly understood. In two experiments, we randomly assign segregation in a laboratory and demonstrate that segregation affects perceptions of other people and causes intergroup bias in costly decision-making. Rather than segregation merely inhibiting intergroup contact, we demonstrate that segregation directly affects perception and thus can affect intergroup relations even when holding contact constant.},

  abstract = {Problem: Localities and states are turning to land planning and urban design for help in reducing automobile use and related social and environmental costs. The effects of such strategies on travel demand have not been generalized in recent years from the multitude of available studies. Purpose: We conducted a meta-analysis of the built environment-travel literature existing at the end of 2009 in order to draw generalizable conclusions for practice. We aimed to quantify effect sizes, update earlier work, include additional outcome measures, and address the methodological issue of self-selection. Methods: We computed elasticities for individual studies and pooled them to produce weighted averages. Results and conclusions: Travel variables are generally inelastic with respect to change in measures of the built environment. Of the environmental variables considered here, none has a weighted average travel elasticity of absolute magnitude greater than 0.39, and most are much less. Still, the combined effect of several such variables on travel could be quite large. Consistent with prior work, we find that vehicle miles traveled (VMT) is most strongly related to measures of accessibility to destinations and secondarily to street network design variables. Walking is most strongly related to measures of land use diversity, intersection density, and the number of destinations within walking distance. Bus and train use are equally related to proximity to transit and street network design variables, with land use diversity a secondary factor. Surprisingly, we find population and job densities to be only weakly associated with travel behavior once these other variables are controlled. Takeaway for practice: The elasticities we derived in this meta-analysis may be used to adjust outputs of travel or activity models that are otherwise insensitive to variation in the built environment, or be used in sketch planning applications ranging from climate action plans to health impact assessments. However, because sample sizes are small, and very few studies control for residential preferences and attitudes, we cannot say that planners should generalize broadly from our results. While these elasticities are as accurate as currently possible, they should be understood to contain unknown error and have unknown confidence intervals. They provide a base, and as more built-environment/travel studies appear in the planning literature, these elasticities should be updated and refined. \textcopyright{} American Planning Association, Chicago, IL.},

  abstract = {The Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC), established in the US during the Great Depression to provide relief to a failing housing market, had a lasting effect through institutionalising the segregationist practice of denying mortgages to communities of colour. Over subsequent decades, `redlining' funnelled billions of US dollars away from minority neighbourhoods and shaped segregation patterns \textendash{} constituting perhaps the most influential example of institutional intervention in the hierarchy of places. This history of racialised exclusion via the process of `spatial marking' is reflected in contemporary housing inequality, which remains one of the most severe sites of racial stratification. This article combines newly-digitised archival data with data describing recent mortgage outcomes to investigate the role of institutional classification of place in the persistence of housing finance inequality. I show that borrowers in the 21st century were at a severe disadvantage when pursuing mortgages in neighbourhoods redlined by HOLC appraisers in the early 20th century. Such applicants were more likely to be denied loans and to receive subprime loans net of measures of selection and ecological disadvantage. This article shows that the geographical patterns of exclusion and exploitation are remarkably stable, and highlights the role of persistent institutional marginalisation in replicating racial and spatial inequalities.},

This study uses census data for all US metropolitan areas in 1980 and 2010 to compare decline in the neighborhood poverty gap between blacks and other Americans with decline in the residential segregation of blacks. We find that both declines resulted primarily from narrowing differences between blacks and whites as opposed to narrowing differences between blacks and Hispanics or blacks and Asians. Because black-white differences in neighborhood poverty declined much faster than black-white segregation, the neighborhood poverty disadvantage of blacks declined faster than black segregation-a noteworthy finding because the narrowing of the racial gap in neighborhood poverty for blacks has gone largely unnoticed. Further analysis reveals that the narrowing of the gap was produced by change in both the medians and shapes of the distribution of poverty across the neighborhoods where blacks, whites, Hispanics, and Asians reside.},

Multilevel models show that black homebuyers are moving into considerably more racially segregated neighborhoods than their white counterparts and that their access to "whiter" neighborhoods did not expand during the housing boom, even after controlling for the racial composition of the metropolitan area and other key ecological factors. Conversely, new white homebuyers have been moving into neighborhoods with greater percent black residents, which may be a contributing factor in observed declines in segregation during the past few decades. Additionally, black homebuyers in metropolitan areas with greater suburban growth were on average accessing homes in more integrated neighborhoods. Finally, the models explained considerably more of the variation in the neighborhood racial composition of whites compared to blacks. These findings are suggestive of a dual housing market, one in which the experiences of blacks are still systematically different than those of whites, despite expanded access to homeownership.}

  abstract = {Cities are complex products of human culture, characterised by a startling diversity of visible traits. Their form is constantly evolving, reflecting changing human needs and local contingencies, manifested in space by many urban patterns. Urban morphology laid the foundation for understanding many such patterns, largely relying on qualitative research methods to extract distinct spatial identities of urban areas. However, the manual, labour-intensive and subjective nature of such approaches represents an impediment to the development of a scalable, replicable and data-driven urban form characterisation. Recently, advances in geographic data science and the availability of digital mapping products open the opportunity to overcome such limitations. And yet, our current capacity to systematically capture the heterogeneity of spatial patterns remains limited in terms of spatial parameters included in the analysis and hardly scalable due to the highly labour-intensive nature of the task. In this paper, we present a method for numerical taxonomy of urban form derived from biological systematics, which allows the rigorous detection and classification of urban types. Initially, we produce a rich numerical characterisation of urban space from minimal data input, minimising limitations due to inconsistent data quality and availability. These are street network, building footprint and morphological tessellation, a spatial unit derivative of Voronoi tessellation, obtained from building footprints. Hence, we derive homogeneous urban tissue types and, by determining overall morphological similarity between them, generate a hierarchical classification of urban form. After framing and presenting the method, we test it on two cities \textendash{} Prague and Amsterdam \textendash{} and discuss potential applications and further developments. The proposed classification method represents a step towards the development of an extensive, scalable numerical taxonomy of urban form and opens the way to more rigorous comparative morphological studies and explorations into the relationship between urban space and phenomena as diverse as environmental performance, health and place attractiveness.},

The results suggest how complex, macro-level patterns of residential segregation can arise from a small set of simple micro-level social dynamics operating within particular urban-demographic contexts.

  abstract = {Although the trend toward greater ethnoracial diversity in the United States has been documented at a variety of geographic scales, most research tracks diversity one scale at a time. Our study bridges scales, asking how the diversity and segregation patterns of metropolitan areas are influenced by shifts in the racial/ethnic composition of their constituent places. Drawing on 1980\textendash 2010 decennial census data, we use a new visual tool to compare the distributions of place diversity for 50 U.S. metro areas over three decades. We also undertake a decomposition analysis of segregation within these areas to evaluate hypotheses about the roles of different types of places in ethnoracial change. The decomposition indicates that although principal cities continue to shape the overall diversity of metro areas, their relative impact has declined since 1980. Inner suburbs have experienced substantial increases in diversity during the same period. Places with large white majorities now contribute more to overall metropolitan diversity than in the past. In contrast, majority black and majority Hispanic places contribute less to metropolitan diversity than in the past. The complexity of the patterns we observe is underscored through an inspection of two featured metropolises: Chicago and Dallas.},

In general, the development of assisted housing in a neighborhood did not lead to racial transition, nor did it approach levels suggesting "white flight" in the few instances where racial transition did occur. The results of our analysis suggest that one of the major criticisms of project-based assisted housing-that it contributes to racial segregation by causing white flight-is not supported by empirical evidence. \textcopyright{} Fannie Mae Foundation 2000.},

The results presented here show that higher socioeconomic status Blacks have more White neighbors, fewer poor neighbors, and live in neighborhoods with higher housing values.

To the extent Blacks are living in more integrated and higher-status neighborhoods, it appears to be because their socioeconomic status is improving.

Discrimination based on Source of Income (SOI), however, could hinder the use of vouchers to move to more desirable neighborhoods. State and local SOI anti-discrimination laws (SOI laws) are one policy response to address this issue. SOI laws make it illegal for landlords to discriminate against voucher recipients solely on the basis of their having a voucher. The research presented here tested whether SOI laws in the USA improve locational outcomes for voucher recipients. This research found that the impacts of SOI laws on locational outcomes are mixed. We found substantively important reductions in neighborhood poverty rates associated with the implementation of SOI laws and small but statistically significant reductions in minority concentration as well. The concentration of voucher recipients in a neighborhood, however, does not appear to be related to SOI law implementation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

We speculate that the increase in white entry into black neighborhoods was due to declining racism among whites and dramatically declining crime rates in the 1990s. We also use multivariate regression to explain which black neighborhoods were most likely to experience an influx of whites. Factors associated with gentrification appear to offer the most promising explanations. We discuss the implications of these findings in the conclusion.},

The paper then probes the myriad idiosyncrasies associated with the concept of neighbourhood: cross-attribute variation in durability and ability to be priced, relativistic evaluations of attributes and consumption impacts on attributes. It discusses how, within this new paradigmatic context, neighbourhoods are produced by the same actors that consume them: households, property owners, business people and local government. Finally, consideration is given to various aspects of the origins and nature of neighbourhood change and it is argued that neighbourhood dynamics are rife with social inef? ciencies.},

  abstract = {Due to the difficulty of tracking large numbers of new migrants, how their daily activity behaviors differ from those of settled residents has not been well investigated, leading to a lack of understanding of new migrants' integration. Meanwhile, existing research largely emphasized residential space and ignored other activity disparities. To obtain a more comprehensive picture of urban segregation, we identified new migrants and two settled urban groups from two kinds of human mobility data. A S-T-A-D-I interactive framework was proposed to measure segregation from multiple activity dimensions, including spatial colocation, temporal coexistence, accessibility, activity diversity, and social interaction. Two-scale analysis of spatial colocation patterns reveals residential segregation by both residential location and housing type, suggesting the effectiveness of the mobility data in profiling socioeconomic groups. The temporal disparity in undertaking activities was unveiled by identifying temporal coexistence patterns. Moreover, the groups presented significant inequality in accessibility owing to the use of different travel modes, leading to a notable disparity in activity diversity. Jointly determined by the disparities in space, time, and diversity, the three groups generated a high level of self-segregation, and new migrants and transit users presented very low interaction potentials with the car group.}

Second, the degree of monocentricity-polycentricity also affects segregation: while a higher concentration of jobs in and around the CBD decreases segregation in monocentric cities, a higher employment concentration in and around subcenters located far from the CBD decreases segregation in polycentric cities. Third, results are heterogeneous according to city size: local density does not increase segregation in small (monocentric) cities, it increases segregation in medium size cities, and it decreases segregation in large (polycentric) cities. Finally, results also differ between income groups: while local density conditions increase the segregation of the poor, a more polycentric configuration reduces the segregation of the rich.},

Using 1990 survey data, discrete-time logit models are estimated to assess the effects of locational, contextual, and personal characteristics on the likelihood of changing residence within the city. The results indicate that locational variables operate in such a way that the most dominant Vietnamese neighborhood in Brisbane increases its prominence even further, while secondary Vietnamese clusters are likely to weaken. The results also indicate that initial settlement conditions are important for the first move only, whereas personal attributes contribute to variations in mobility propensities primarily in the second move. This implies that the composition of the immigrant population potentially influences the speed at which changes in ethnic residential patterns will occur in urban areas. \textcopyright{} 1998 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.

Public housing programmes in each country have been, at differing points in time, important cornerstone's of the welfare state but each has become a residualised sector of the housing delivery system. In the context of such residualisation, the key issue to consider is whether British council housing is likely to reproduce the patterns of racial segregation, impoverishment, and discrimination which are endemic in the American public housing system. A variety of administrative agency reports and data, court cases, as well as case studies of race and public housing policies in the US and England have been used in this paper (Smith and Whalley, 1975; Commission for Racial Equality seriatim; Hirsch, 1983; Bauman, 1987; Department of the Environment; Smith, 1989). Unpublished tables for the English Housing Trailer for the 1988 Labour Force Survey were provided by the Department of the Environment. Despite the presence of such information, there are a number of resource and data gathering concerns that affect the understanding of the interrelationships between race, class, and public housing policy on a comparative basis including: constrained research resources; unreliable data collection procedures; unavailability of time series data; and chronically limited research on civil rights/organisational effectiveness (Liebert, 1981). Despite these shortcomings, there are a significant number of both academic and applied studies in the area which suggest basic themes, issues and hypotheses for future examination.},

What Allen and Vignoles have done is useful because it directly replicates my earlier analyses of trends in social segregation between schools since 1989.

The same substantive trends appear whatever sensible index of segregation is used - the clustering of pupils living in poverty in the same schools declined in the early 1990s, stabilised in the mid-1990s, and has been increasing since then. However, Allen and Vignoles appear to ignore some of the earlier findings of mine that they have replicated, and make some intriguing errors when discussing how to measure segregation, especially in relation to the properties of the Gorard segregation index (GS).}

Following a cohort of household heads in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find that white households whose oldest child is younger than six are more likely to move when the percentage of black residents and diversity in their neighborhoods is higher. However, when white households with children do move, they are not more likely than white households without children to move to neighborhoods with fewer blacks or less diversity. Young children may matter for segregation because they influence families to leave more diverse neighborhoods, and white movers generally move into neighborhoods with less diversity, whether or not they have children.

While for low values of the density of empty sites, the mobility enhances the convergence to a global culture, for high enough values of it, the dynamics can lead to the coexistence of disconnected domains of different cultures. In this regime, the increase in initial cultural diversity paradoxically increases the convergence to a dominant culture. Further increase in diversity leads to the fragmentation of the dominant culture into domains, forever changing in shape and number, as an effect of the never ending eroding activity of cultural minorities. \textcopyright{} 2009 The American Physical Society.},

Racial variation occurs between t-communities not within them, even when both distances between block groups or, in the case of households with children, racial variation between elementary schools is accounted for. While Grannis (1998) examined how similar t-communities connected by pedestrian streets were to each other, this study examines how internally homogeneous t-communities themselves are. Further, this study's analysis of households with children finds that they have settled in such a way as to assure a racially homogeneous t-community more than a racially homogeneous school. By analyzing the entire metropolitan areas of PMSAs in different regions, this study also discovered very large t-communities, hundreds of times larger than a typical t-community, in which pedestrian streets no longer have an important influence},

  abstract = {We propose an analytical solution to a Schelling segregation model for a relatively broad range of utility functions. Using evolutionary game theory, we provide existence conditions for a potential function, which characterizes the global configuration of the city and is maximized in the stationary state. We use this potential function to analyze the outcome of the model for three utility functions corresponding to different degrees of preference for mixed neighborhoods: (i) we show that linear utility functions is the only case where the potential function is proportional to collective utility, the latter being therefore maximized in stationary configurations; (ii) Schelling's original utility function is shown to drive segregation at the expense of collective utility; (iii) if agents have a strict preference for mixed neighborhoods but also prefer to be in the majority versus the minority, the model converges to perfectly segregated configurations, which clearly diverge from the social optimum. Departing from the existing literature, these conclusions are based on analytical results which open the way to analysis of many preference structures. Since our model is based on bounded rather than continuous neighborhoods as in Schelling's original model, we discuss the differences generated by the bounded- and continuous-neighborhood definitions and show that, in the case of the continuous neighborhood, a potential function exists if and only if the utility functions are linear. A side result is that our analysis builds a bridge between Schelling's model and the Duncan and Duncan segregation index. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

This assumption has been increasingly subject to critique among demographers and ethnographers and becomes especially problematic in historical settings. In the late nineteenth-century United States, standard measures suggest a counterintuitive pattern: southern cities, with their long history of racial inequality, had less residential segregation than urban areas considered to be more racially tolerant. By using census enumeration procedures, we develop a sequence measure that captures a more subtle "backyard" pattern of segregation, where white families dominated front streets and blacks were relegated to alleys. Our analysis of complete household data from the 1880 Census documents how segregation took various forms across the postbellum United States. Whereas northern cities developed segregation via racialized neighborhoods, substituting residential inequality for the status inequality of slavery, southern cities embraced street-front segregation that reproduced the racial inequality that existed under slavery.},

We find that the foreclosure crisis was patterned strongly along racial lines: black, Latino, and racially integrated neighborhoods had exceptionally high foreclosure rates. Multilevel models of racial/ethnic change reveal that foreclosure concentrations were linked to declining shares of whites and expanding shares of black and Latino residents. Results further suggest that these compositional shifts were driven by both white population loss and minority growth, especially from racially mixed settings with high foreclosure rates. To explore the impact of these racially selective migration streams on patterns of residential segregation, we simulate racial segregation assuming that foreclosure rates remained at their 2005 levels throughout the crisis period. Our simulations suggest that the foreclosure crisis increased racial segregation between blacks and whites by 1.1 dissimilarity points, and between Latinos and whites by 2.2 dissimilarity points.},

To do so, we use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to track foreclosure, migration, and neighborhood outcomes for samples of white, black, and Hispanic homeowners. Findings from our analysis show clearly that foreclosure was linked to migration to less white and more residentially disadvantaged neighborhoods, with foreclosed Hispanic householders, in particular, tending to move to poorer and more racially isolated neighborhoods.},

While past scholarship has focused largely on residential contexts, a considerable portion of individuals' days is spent outside of the home and existing research misses the potential for cross-group contact in non-residential contexts. In this paper, we assess the levels and patterns of segregation in the environments where people spend their workday, for white, black, Hispanic, and Asian workers. Using commuting data from the Census Transportation Planning Package, we construct measures of racial composition in ``workhoods'' and compare metropolitan-level segregation in places of work and home. Results indicate that workhood segregation is substantially lower than residential segregation. Black-white segregation in work settings is, for example, half the level of black-white segregation in residential settings. Multivariate analyses also reveal that workhood segregation, for all groups, is higher in metropolitan areas with greater residential segregation. For Hispanic workers, areas with larger immigrant populations have higher workhood segregation, and for blacks, workhood segregation is lower in metropolitan areas with large military populations. Our findings also consistently show that black and Hispanic workhood segregation is lower in areas where minority groups are more occupationally disadvantaged.},

This starkly contrasts commonly used spatial econometric specification strategies and is a complement to the critique of spatial econometrics raised in a special theme issue of the Journal of Regional Science (Volume 52, Issue 2).

The analysis shows evidence of socioeconomic decline in Baltimore's inner suburbs, but the extent of this decline varies among these suburbs. Since 1980, many declining inner suburbs had difficulty attracting new residents, White flight was the prevailing trend, and the housing stock was outdated relative to the outer suburbs. The analysis suggests three major influences on decline among the inner suburbs of Baltimore: labor market restructuring, the nature of the local housing market, and income and racial segregation. This paper concludes with a classification of Baltimore's inner suburbs based on our understanding of the processes of suburban decline in the region.},

  abstract = {Geodemographics as the ``analysis of people by where they live'' has origins in urban sociology and social mapping, and is experiencing a renaissance in applied spatial demography. However, some commentators have expressed reservations about the statistical limitations of common geodemographic practices, especially focusing on the potential internal heterogeneity of the geodemographic groupings, as well as the problem of clearly identifying predictor variables that might account for or explain the socioeconomic patterns revealed by geodemographic analyses. In this paper we argue that geodemographic typologies are structured methods for making sense of the spatial and socioeconomic patterns encoded within complex datasets such as national census data. By treating geodemographics as more a framework than a tool for analysis in its own right we are able to integrate it with the flexibility and statistical conventions offered by multilevel modeling. We demonstrate this with a case study of whether pupils from different types of neighborhood in Birmingham, England are more or less likely to attend their nearest state-funded secondary school and how that likelihood varies with the ethnic composition of the neighborhood. In so doing we build on previous research suggesting that ethnic segregation between schools is at least equal to that between neighborhoods in England and speculate in this regard on the consequences of current government plans to extend choice to parents within a schools market.},

  abstract = {The Schelling model of segregation is an agent-based model that illustrates how individual tendencies regarding neighbors can lead to segregation. The model is especially useful for the study of residential segregation of ethnic groups where agents represent householders who relocate in the city. In the model, each agent belongs to one of two groups and aims to reside within a neighborhood where the fraction of 'friends' is sufficiently high: above a predefined tolerance threshold value F. It is known that depending on F, for groups of equal size, Schelling's residential pattern converges to either complete integration (a random-like pattern) or segregation. The study of high-resolution ethnic residential patterns of Israeli cities reveals that reality is more complicated than this simple integration-segregation dichotomy: some neighborhoods are ethnically homogeneous while others are populated by both groups in varying ratios. In this study, we explore whether the Schelling model can reproduce such patterns. We investigate the model's dynamics in terms of dependence on group-specific tolerance thresholds and on the ratio of the size of the two groups. We reveal new type of model pattern in which a portion of one group segregates while another portion remains integrated with the second group. We compare the characteristics of these new patterns to the pattern of real cities and discuss the differences.},

In that article, Schelling presented a family of models, one of which became a canonical model. To date it is called the Schelling model \textendash{} an eponym that affixes the inventor's name to the invention, one of the highest forms of scientific recognition. In the very first issue of JMS, James Minoru Sakoda published an article entitled ``The Checkerboard Model of Social Interaction''. Sakoda's article more or less went unrecognized. Yet, a careful comparison demonstrates that in a certain sense the Schelling model is just an instance of Sakoda's model. A precursor of that model was already part of Sakoda's 1949 dissertation submitted to the University of California at Berkeley. A substantial amount of evidence indicates that in the 1970s Sakoda was well known and recognized as a computational social scientist, whereas Schelling was an unknown in the field. A generation later, the pattern of recognition almost completely reversed: Sakoda had become the unknown, while Schelling was the well-known inventor of the pioneering Schelling model. This article explains this puzzling pattern of recognition. Technical and social factors play a decisive role. Some contrafactual historical reflection suggests that the final result was not inevitable.},

Many analyses of segregation and clustering use the ratio or difference between a value for an areal unit and the corresponding value for a larger area of reference. We argue that the results of such an analysis can also be rendered arbitrary if one does not examine the effects of varying the geographical extent of the area of reference to test whether the analysis results are valid for more than a specific areal delineation.

  abstract = {In many social networks, there is a high correlation between the similarity of actors and the existence of relationships between them. This paper introduces a model of network evolution where actors are assumed to have a small aversion from being connected to others who are dissimilar to themselves, and yet no actor strictly prefers a segregated network. This model is motivated by Schelling's [Schelling TC (1969) Models of segregation. Am Econ Rev 59:488-493] classic model of residential segregation, and we show that Schelling's results also apply to the structure of networks; namely, segregated networks always emerge regardless of the level of aversion. In addition, we prove analytically that attribute similarity among connected network actors always reaches a stationary distribution, and this distribution is independent of network topology and the level of aversion bias. This research provides a basis for more complex models of social interaction that are driven in part by the underlying attributes of network actors and helps advance our understanding of why dysfunctional social network structures may emerge.},

  abstract = {Policy-makers in industrialised countries have been implementing polices to create neighbourhoods with diverse populations in the hopes of increasing and ameliorating inter-ethnic relations. However, social networks seem to remain largely segregated. The composition of people's social networks is traditionally explained by population compositions and subsequent meeting opportunities versus preferences for homophilious interaction. Little attention has been paid to the social construction behind these two factors. This study of Turkish and native Dutch individuals in two neighbourhoods in Rotterdam from a time-geographic perspective shows that path-dependency plays a large role in keeping social networks segregated. The social circles individuals engage in during their lives are linked together. Individuals are introduced to places, activities and people by their existing social networks, starting with their parents and siblings. As such, they are likely to roam in spaces dominated by people of their own ethnicity, which lessens the opportunity to meet people from other ethnic backgrounds. This role of people's existing social networks in ethnic segregation has been overlooked in the integration debate so far.},

Researchers have consistently argued that HOLC caused redlining and disinvestment in U.S. cities by sharing its color-coded maps. Geographic information systems and spatial statistical models were used to analyze address-level mortgage data from Philadelphia to determine if areas with worse grades actually had less access to residential mortgage credit as a result. Findings indicate that the grades on HOLC's map do not explain differences in lending patterns with the exception of interest rates, which were higher in areas colored red. Archival material and journal articles from the 1930s also reveal that lenders were avoiding areas colored red before HOLC made its maps, that HOLC's maps were not widely distributed, and that lenders had other sources of information about real estate risk levels. \textcopyright{} 2003, SAGE Publications.

Employing a unique sample that places housing units into micro-neighborhoods and census tracts, this study tests whether the characteristics of the previous residents of the unit, the local micro-neighborhood, or the broader tract best explain the race/ethnicity of the new residents in a housing unit. The results show that the racial/ethnic composition of the local micro-neighborhood has even stronger effects on the race/ethnicity of the new residents than does the racial/ethnic composition of the broader census tract. The results also reveal that even when the racial/ethnic composition of these two contexts are accounted for, the race/ethnicity of the prior residents has a very strong effect on the race/ethnicity of the new residents. I consider possible explanations for this household-level effect. One new theoretical explanation I put forward is that prospective residents use the race/ethnicity of the prior residents as a signal regarding the neighborhood's appropriateness for them; I test and find that this hypothesized signaling effect is even stronger in certain micro-neighborhood, neighborhood, and county contexts.},

Although scholars frequently lament the inadequacies of the various existing definitions of ``neighborhood,'' we argue that previous strategies relying on nonoverlapping boundaries such as block groups and tracts are fundamentally flawed. The approach taken here instead builds on insights of the mental mapping literature, the social networks literature, the daily activities pattern literature, and the travel to crime literature to propose a new definition of neighborhoods: egohoods. These egohoods are conceptualized as waves washing across the surface of cities, as opposed to independent units with nonoverlapping boundaries. This approach is illustrated using crime data from nine cities: Buffalo, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Dallas, Los Angeles, Sacramento, St. Louis, and Tucson. The results show that measures aggregated to our egohoods explain more of the variation in crime across the social environment than do models with measures aggregated to block groups or tracts. The results also suggest that measuring inequality in egohoods provides dramatically stronger positive effects on crime rates than when using the nonoverlapping boundary approach, highlighting the important new insights that can be obtained by using our egohood approach.},

Blau offered a powerful explanation: people connect with one another based on their positions in a social space. Yet a principled measure of social distance, allowing comparison within and between societies, remains elusive. We use the connectivity kernel of conditionally independent edge models to develop a family of segregation statistics with desirable properties: they offer an intuitive and universal characteristic scale on social space (facilitating comparison across datasets and societies), are applicable to multivariate and mixed node attributes, and capture segregation at the level of individuals, pairs of individuals and society as a whole. We show that the segregation statistics can induce a metric on Blau space (a space spanned by the attributes of the members of society) and provide maps of two societies. Under a Bayesian paradigm, we infer the parameters of the connectivity kernel from 11 ego-network datasets collected in four surveys in the UK and USA. The importance of different dimensions of Blau space is similar across time and location, suggesting a macroscopically stable social fabric. Physical separation and age differences have the most significant impact on segregation within friendship networks with implications for intergenerational mixing and isolation in later stages of life.},

While various indices have been developed as a response to different definitions of segregation, the reliance on such single-figure indices could oversimplify the complex, multidimensional phenomena. In this regard, this paper suggests an alternative graph-based approach that provides more detailed information than simple indices: The concentration profile graphically conveys information about how evenly a population group is distributed over the study region, and the spatial proximity profile depicts the degree of clustering across different threshold levels. These graphs can also be summarized into single numbers for comparative purposes, but the interpretation can be more accurate by inspecting the additional information. To demonstrate the use of these methods, the residential patterns of three major ethnic groups in Auckland, namely M\=aori, Pacific peoples, and Asians, are examined using the 2006 census data. \textcopyright{} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Using data from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Census, supplemented with data on the racial composition of LIHTC tenants in three states, we examine three potential channels through which the LIHTC could affect segregation: where LIHTC units are built relative to where other low income households live, who lives in these tax credit developments, and changes in neighborhood racial composition in neighborhoods that receive tax credit projects. The evidence on each of these channels suggests that LIHTC projects do not contribute to increased segregation, even those in high poverty neighborhoods. We find that increases in the use of tax credits are associated with declines in racial segregation at the metropolitan level.},

  abstract = {Abstract: The spatial mismatch hypothesis postulates that employment deconcen- tration within U.S. metropolitan areas goes some way toward explaining higher unem- ployment and lower wages among ethnic minority groups, since these groups are more likely to reside in central-city areas. However, little consensus has emerged on the importance of spatial mismatch in explaining disadvantage in the labor market. This article argues that conflicting evidence is the result of the variety of methods that have been used to test the spatial mismatch hypothesis. Moreover, it draws attention to a number of hitherto uncovered flaws in some of these methods that introduce systematic biases against finding evidence in support of the hypothesis. In light of these flaws, favored methods for future research are highlighted. Drawing on evidence from British conurbations that display similar spatial inequalities to U.S. metropolitan areas despite much smaller ethnic minority populations, the article contends that race does not lie at the heart of the spatial mismatch problem. Three areas in which the spatial mismatch hypothesis should be reconceptualized are iden- tified: first, its emphasis should be on spatial, not racial, inequalities; second, it needs to differentiate between residential immobility and residential segregation, which are quite different; and third, it needs to recognize that the extent and the effect of spatial mismatch are distinct and should be measured separately.},

Recent advances in spatial analysis and geographic information systems present new opportunities for researchers to exploit the potential of housing submarkets as constructs that offer a more precise way to examine residential segregation. The article synthesizes literature related to residential segregation and housing submarkets and demonstrates how to delineate housing submarkets using publicly available data. It examines the spatial distribution of housing submarkets and how the socially disadvantaged are represented across housing submarkets in St. Louis, Missouri, and Cincinnati, Ohio, to conclude that St. Louis's housing market is more polarized and racially segregated than Cincinnati's. Spatial analysis of housing submarkets, in conjunction with archival analysis, provides a promising avenue for identifying residential segregation as a multidimensional phenomenon, and a means to explore local processes of urban inequality.},

The share of all minorities is negatively associated with gentrification during the 1970s and 1980s, and, in contrast to expectations, shares of Blacks positively predict recent gentrification while shares of Asians negatively predict it. Increased concentrations of recent immigrants in neighborhoods with greater shares of Asians explain these relationships. These findings suggest that where arriving immigrants move limits residential selection in gentrification and shifts pressures to low-cost Black neighborhoods.

Some scholars, politicians and real estate boosters celebrate this urban population influx, as it will likely increase property values and municipal tax bases; however, we know little about the social costs associated with the back-to-the-city movement. This study investigates the consequences of the back-to-the-city movement through a four-year (2009-2012) ethnographic case study of the revitalisation of Washington, DC's Shaw/U Street neighbourhood. The redevelopment of this African-American neighbourhood is associated with the city's 5.2 percent population increase, which occurred between 2000 and 2010. While affordable housing efforts help to keep a portion of long-term, low-income residents in place, political and cultural displacement is occurring as upper-income newcomers flock into this neighbourhood. This article contributes to the urban literature by highlighting that population influx, and associated neighbourhood revitalisation, can have important social implications.},

This analysis examines segregation in the multi-ethnic context over the 1980\textendash 2000 period by using the multi-race information theory index (H), which simultaneously takes the presence of many groups into account, and by also looking at the segregation of each group separately. Results indicate that segregation has been decreasing, mainly due to declines in African American segregation and White segregation with little change or slight increases in Asian and Hispanic segregation. Growing diversity was associated with increases in overall segregation, White segregation, Hispanic segregation, and Asian segregation, though strongly associated with declines in Black segregation. For Hispanics and Asians, it was the growth in Hispanic and Asian and Pacific Islander populations, respectively, that were associated with increases in segregation, suggesting that this population growth likely buttressed ethnic enclaves.},

This hypothesis maintains that the suburbanization of jobs and involuntary housing market segregation have acted together to create a surplus of workers relative to the number of available jobs in submetropolitan areas where blacks are concentrated. Since Kain's review, more than two dozen new studies on the spatial mismatch hypothesis have been completed. Generally, these studies use more suitable data and superior methodologies than earlier studies and therefore provide the most reliable evidence to date on the spatial mismatch hypothesis. This article critically reviews the new studies and assesses what implications can be drawn for welfare reform.},

  abstract = {Within the housing segregation literature major disagreements have developed over two fundamental issues: (1) the role that whites' aversion to racially mixed neighbourhoods plays in causing modern segregation in the US; and (2) the factors that underlie this aversion, including the effects of inter?racial contact on whites' neighbourhood racial preferences and whether these preferences reflect neighbourhood stereotyping as opposed to pure racial prejudice. Extant evidence on these issues is either old or indirect. This paper provides direct evidence on these issues using new data from the Multi?City Study of Urban Inequality. The results suggest that (1) whites' neighbourhood racial preferences play an important role in explaining the racial composition of their neighbourhoods; (2) inter?racial contact in neighbourhoods and workplaces leads to a greater willingness among whites to live with blacks; and (3) although younger and more educated whites express a stronger taste for integration than other whites, the magnitude of these differences leads to only a small increase in the black percentage of the neighbourhood. In addition, the results provide no evidence in support of the hypothesis that whites stereotype black neighbourhoods rather than blacks per se.}

Although Hispanics and Asians have always displayed declining levels of minority-white dissimilarity and rising levels of minority-white interaction with rising income, income differentials on these outcomes for blacks did not appear until 1990 and since then have improved at a very slow pace. Given their higher overall levels of segregation and income's limited effect on residential attainment, African Americans experience less integration, more neighborhood poverty at all levels of income compared to other minority groups. The degree of black spatial disadvantage is especially acute in the nation's 21 hypersegregated metropolitan areas.},

It is argued here that the concept of segregation refers to distributional differences across subunits \& that measures of segregation should be measures of dispersion rather than central tendency. Four basic principles of segregation measurement are proposed, \& five specific measures of segregation are analyzed for consistency with the four principles. Only two measures (the Atkinson \& the Gini Indexes) satisfy all four principles. These two measures tend to rank the levels of segregation in different units similarly, yet they sometimes disagree. Variation in segregation ranks is more pronounced for the remaining three measures, as is demonstrated empirically for a set of US public school districts in 1976. If Lorenz curves for two different districts cross, disagreement among segregation measures is more pronounced. Thus, choice of segregation measures can affect conclusions derived from empirical analyses of segregation. 1 Table, 4 Figures, 24 References. AA}

  abstract = {Compared to residential segregation by race, economic segregation has received relatively little attention in recent empirical literature. Yet a heated debate has arisen concerning Wilson's (1987) hypothesis that increasing economic segregation among African Americans plays a role in the formation of urban ghettos. I present a methodological critique of the measure of economic segregation used by Massey and Eggers (1990) and argue that their measure confounds changes in the income distribution with spatial changes. I develop a "pure" measure of economic segregation based on the correlation ratio and present findings for all U.S. metropolitan areas from 1970 to 1990. Economic segregation increased steadily for Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics in the 1970s and 1980s, but the increases have been particularly large and widespread for Blacks and Hispanics in the 1980s. I explore the causes of these changes in a reduced-form, fixed-effects model. Social distance and structural economic transformations affect economic segregation, but the large increases in economic segregation among minorities in the 1980s cannot be explained by the model. These rapid increases in economic segregation, especially in the context of recent, albeit small, declines in racial segregation, have important implications for urban policy, poverty policy, and the stability of urban communities.},

We show that place-based segregation indices derived from both datasets indicate similar levels of ethnic segregation. From an activity space perspective, the results show that the main socio-economic factor affecting the extensity of activity spaces is self-estimated social status rather than education and income. Results show that ethnic inequality in spatial behaviour is not straightforward, but rather that it is linked to how individuals position themselves in society. We argue that socio-economic factors need to be controlled to examine ethnic segregation from activity space perspective.},

Free Press, Glencoe, 1961) explication that any measure of segregation at a fine-grained scale necessarily incor-porates, to an unknown extent, segregation at a larger scale within which the finer-grained units are nested. To avoid that problem, a multi-level modelling perspective is introduced that identifies the intensity of segregation at each scale net of its intensity at any larger scale included in the analysis. It is applied to an analysis of the emergence of Chicago's Black ghetto over the twentieth century's first three decades, using data at the ward and ED scales. It shows that across Chicago as a whole segregation was equally as intense at the two scales, with statistically significant increases in that intensity at both scales across the three decades. At the finer scale, however, segregation was much more intense across the EDs within those wards that formed the core of the emerging ghetto than it was in the remainder of the city.},

Moreover, this model distinguishes segregation as unevenness and as spatial clustering in the presence of stochastic variation. The modelling approach, unlike traditional index approaches, allows hypothesis evaluation concerning alternative scales and zonation through an accompanying badness-of-fit measure. Ultimately, this permits the identification of the scale and zonation regime where the spatial patterns come into focus thereby directly tackling the modifiable areal unit problem. The model is applied to Indian ethnicity in Leicester, UK, finding segregation as unevenness and as spatial clustering at multiple scales.},

  abstract = {This paper suggests a procedure to control for independent variables in the measurement of segregation by linking the well known Index of Dissimilarity and the Multinomial Logit Model. While the first one may be considered as a standard macro measure of inequality, the latter one is a typical tool to analyze the determinants of individual behavior and attainment. Combining both enables a judgement or a comparison of inequality structures taking into account respective distributions of relevant influential variables. After a short review of the debates on segregation indexes, the technique is described in detail. It is further illustrated using an example dealing with the assimilation by family types of foreigners in the Federal Republic of Germany. It is demonstrated that the method may be a helpful tool to come to more adequate judgements concerning the development of inequality structures.},

However, other demographic processes, such as natural change and international migration, also matter. This paper contributes to the literature by unravelling the impacts of different demographic processes to changes in ethnic segregation. It uses longitudinal individual-level register data on the complete population of the Helsinki region in Finland. We calculate observed changes in exposure indices, segregation indices in counterfactual scenarios, and decompositions of population changes. Results indicate that intraregional migration is the main process affecting segregation between Finnish-origin and non-Western-origin populations, but whereas migration of the former increases segregation, migration of the latter decreases it. International migration and natural change among the non-Western-origin population are the main processes increasing exposure of the non-Western-origin population to other members of the group. No indication is found of a general tendency to ``self-segregate.''.},

Models like Schelling (1971) show that segregation can arise through white preferences for residing near minorities. Once the threshold or ``tipping point'' is passed, the models predict that all whites will leave. Our paper uses census-tract data for six cities in the United States from the 1930s and 1970\textendash 2010 to measure decadal, city-specific tipping points. We use a structural break procedure to estimate the tipping points and incorporate these in a regression-discontinuity design to estimate the impact on population trends for neighborhoods that exceed that threshold while controlling for city-specific trends in migration. We find that the magnitude of white flight for neighborhoods that have tipped in 2000 has fallen to between 23\% and 36\% of the level seen in 1970. There was no discontinuity in white flight after accounting for migration trends during the Great Depression. Finally, we show that in-migration of minorities in tipped neighborhoods do not fill in the gap left by white flight.},

  abstract = {Investigating the role of preferences in causing persistent patterns of racial residential segregation in the United States has a long history. In this paper, we bring a new perspective -- and new data from the 2004 Detroit Area Study -- to the question of how best to characterize black and white preferences toward living in neighborhoods with people of different races. White and black residents of the Detroit metropolitan area (n = 734) were asked in an area probability sample survey about their evaluations of 33 actual communities throughout their metro area. These evaluations are used as an indirect measure of racial residential preferences by viewing how race -- both of the respondent and of the community -- shapes them. We find modest racial agreement about which communities would be "seriously considered" and "never considered" as a place to live, but by and large perceptions of the metropolis are racialized. Whites are influenced by the percentage white in a community (net of the community's social class characteristics) and very unlikely to consider communities where they are anything but the strong majority. African Americans are also influenced by race, but in different ways and less fundamentally: 1.) Communities with high percentages of African Americans are among those most likely to be "seriously considered," but so are communities with just a handful of African Americans; 2.) African Americans are less likely to "never consider" all communities, and more likely than whites to consider both communities where they are in the majority and in the minority; 3.) African Americans are unaffected by a community's percent white net of community social class characteristics. We place these results in the context of the debate about racial residential preferences, arguing for the importance of grounding our understanding - and measures - of racial residential preferences in the context of real urban landscapes.},

This article tests the racial proxy hypothesis using an innovative experiment that isolates the net effects of race and social class, followed by an analysis of the social psychological factors associated with residential preferences. The authors find that net of social class, the race of a neighborhood's residents significantly influenced how it was rated. Whites said the all-white neighborhoods were most desirable. The independent effect of racial composition was smaller among blacks, who identified the racially mixed neighborhood as most desirable. Further, whites who held negative stereotypes about African-Americans and the neighborhoods where they live were significantly influenced by neighborhood racial composition. None of the proposed social psychological factors conditioned African-Americans' sensitivity to neighborhood racial composition.},

Some portion of segregation is attributable to socioeconomic differences across racial lines; some portion is caused by purely racial factors, such as preferences about the racial composition of one's neighborhood or discrimination in the housing market. Social scientists have had great difficulty disaggregating segregation into a portion that can be explained by interracial differences in socioeconomic characteristics (what we call structural factors) versus a portion attributable to racial and ethnic factors. What would such a measure look like? In this paper, we draw on a new source of data to develop an innovative structural segregation measure that shows the amount of segregation that would remain if we could assign households to housing units based only on non-racial socioeconomic characteristics. This inquiry provides vital building blocks for the broader enterprise of understanding and remedying housing segregation.}

  abstract = {Although a number of definitions of mixing have been proposed in the literature, no single definition accurately and clearly describes the full range of problems in the field of industrial mixing. An alternate approach is proposed which defines segregation as being composed of three separate dimensions. The first dimension is the intensity of segregation quantified by the normalized concentration variance (CoV); the second dimension is the scale of segregation or clustering; and the last dimension is the exposure or the potential to reduce segregation. The first dimension focuses on the instantaneous concentration variance; the second on the instantaneous length scales in the mixing field; and the third on the driving force for change, i.e. the mixing time scale, or the instantaneous rate of reduction in segregation. With these three dimensions in hand, it is possible to speak more clearly about what is meant by the control of segregation in industrial mixing processes. In this paper, the three dimensions of segregation are presented and defined in the context of previous definitions of mixing, and then applied to a range of industrial mixing problems to test their accuracy and robustness. \textcopyright{} 2009 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.},

It argues for the need to expand our analytical focus from static residential spaces to other relevant places and times inpeople's everyday lives.Mobility is anessential element of people's spatiotemporal experiences, and these complex experiences cannot be fully understood by just looking at where people live. As many social scientists are interested in studying segregation, environmental exposure, and accessibility, geographers can contribute to advancing temporally integrated analysis of these issues through careful examination of people's everyday experiences as their lives unfold in space and time.

Analysis results demonstrate the decreases in both white flight and white avoidance over time. Whites stayed shorter in black-white neighborhoods than in predominantly white neighborhoods until 1990, but this has been no longer significant during the past two decades. The tendency that whites are less likely to move to racially homogeneous neighborhoods than moving within or across racially mixed neighborhoods was significant only after 1990. These two results explain the aggregate-level segregation trend that black-white neighborhoods have experienced the most significant drop in the probability of transitioning into racially homogeneous neighborhoods and that the share of racially mixed neighborhoods has significantly increased over time. Analysis results further suggest that increasing racial diversity and the reduction in racial segregation in metropolitan areas have likely contributed to changes in whites' residential mobility.},

Although it is widely assumed that local land use regulations\textemdash such as minimum lot sizes and growth controls\textemdash exclude low-income households from wealthier neighborhoods, the empirical research is surprisingly limited. We examine the relationship between land use regulation and segregation by income using new measures for the 95 biggest cities in the United States. We find that density restrictions are associated with the segregation of the wealthy and middle income, but not the poor. We also find that more local pressure to regulate land use is linked to higher rates of income segregation, but that more state control is connected to lower-income segregation.Takeaway for practice: Density restrictions do drive urban income segregation of the rich, not the poor, but should be addressed because rich enclaves create significant metropolitan problems. Planners at the local level need assistance from regional and state efforts to ameliorate income segregation. Inclusionary housing requirements have a greater potential to reduce income segregation than bringing higher-income households into lower-income parts of the city. Finally, comprehensive and consistent data on the impacts of local land use regulations should be collected to inform future research and planning practice.},

The present paper investigates social segregation over the 24~h a day in the Paris region, taking into account how social groups move within a city throughout the day. From a large and precise daily travel survey carried out in the Paris region (EGT 2010) among 25,500 respondents aged 16 or over, we have computed segregation indices and maps hour by hour from respondents' educational and socioprofessional indicators. We then observed that social segregation within the Paris region decreases during the day and that the most segregated group (the upper class group) during the night remains the most segregated during the day. We also explored how the co-presence between various social groups evolves throughout the day. Finally, we highlighted some large variations in districts' social composition over 24~h: districts with similar social composition during the night can differ deeply in their social composition during the day-time because of socially selective daily trips. Exploring social segregation around the clock helps in considering more dynamically place effects on individual behavior and targeting areas to implement interventions more connected with the real city rhythm.},

  abstract = {The changing color line in the United States is perhaps best expressed in the geographic separation of racial groups\textemdash in shifting pat-terns of neighborhood residential segregation (Charles 2003). As we argue in this article, the optimism associated with recent declines in racial segregation in U.S. metropolitan areas may be dampened by new evidence of racial and ethnic geographic balkanization at other levels of geography (Fischer et al. 2004; Parisi, Lichter, and Taquino 2011, 2015). Abstract This article documents a new macro-segregation, where the locus of racial differentiation resides increasingly in socio-spatial processes at the community or place level. The goal is to broaden the spatial lens for studying segregation, using decennial Census data on 222 metropolitan areas. Unlike previous neighborhood studies of racial change, we decompose metropolitan segregation into its within-and between-place components from 1990 to 2010. This is accomplished with the Theil index (H). Our decomposition of H reveals large post-1990 declines in metropolitan segregation. But, significantly, macro-segregation\textemdash the between-place component\textemdash has increased since 1990, offsetting declines in the within-place component. The macro component of segregation is also most pronounced and increasing most rapidly among blacks, accounting for roughly one-half of all metro segregation in the most segregated metropolitan areas of the United States. Macro-segregation is least evident among Asians, which suggests other members of these communities (i.e., middle-class or affluent ethnoburbs) have less resistance to Asians relocating there. These results on emerging patterns of macro-segregation are confirmed in fixed-effects models that control for unobserved heterogeneity across metropolitan areas. Unlike most previous studies focused on the uneven distribution of racial and ethnic groups across metropolitan neighborhoods, we show that racial residential segregation is increasingly shaped by the cities and suburban communities in which neighborhoods are embedded.},

  abstract = {Rural America has seemingly been ``left behind'' in an era of massive immigration and growing diversity. The arrival of new immigrants has exposed many rural whites, perhaps for the first time, to racial and ethnic minority populations. Do rural whites increasingly live in racially diverse nonmetropolitan places? Or is white exposure to racially diverse populations expressed in uneven patterns of residential integration from place to place? We link microdata from the Panel Survey of Income Dynamics (1989-to-2009 waves) to place data identified in the 1990\textendash 2010 decennial censuses. We estimate multilevel, fixed-effects models of rural white exposure to minority populations that involve linking individual predictors to changing demographic and economic local environments. Using entropy scores, our analyses highlight the extraordinary rise since 1990 in exposure of all rural populations, including whites, to racially diverse communities. Variation in white exposure to rural minorities is driven primarily by changing local demographic and economic conditions. Net of individual background characteristics, whites are significantly less likely to live in racially diverse places than other ethnoracial groups. White population growth is occurring disproportionately in the least racially diverse rural communities. For blacks and other minorities, growth is taking place disproportionately in the most racially diverse places.},

An asymmetric measure of isolation is described here, one which takes composition into account. Although it taps the same process in part, the measure provides a different way of approaching segregation and is found not to be a simple product of a composition variable coupled with the index of dissimilarity. Earlier conclusions about intercity differences and temporal changes in segregation between 1960 and 1970 are reconsidered. Certain features of segregation are indicated that hitherto were unappreciated. Recognition of them yields some radically different conclusions about the segregation process, shifts over time, and differences among cities. The asymmetrical approach also explains why racial and ethnic groups have different perceptions about the magnitude of and the trends in segregation.},

  abstract = {Redlining was a racially discriminatory housing policy established by the federal government's Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) during the 1930s. For decades, redlining limited access to homeownership and wealth creation among racial minorities, contributing to a host of adverse social outcomes, including high unemployment, poverty, and residential vacancy, that persist today. While the multigenerational socioeconomic impacts of redlining are increasingly understood, the impacts on urban environments and ecosystems remain unclear. To begin to address this gap, we investigated how the HOLC policy administered 80 years ago may relate to present-day tree canopy at the neighborhood level. Urban trees provide many ecosystem services, mitigate the urban heat island effect, and may improve quality of life in cities. In our prior research in Baltimore, MD, we discovered that redlining policy influenced the location and allocation of trees and parks. Our analysis of 37 metropolitan areas here shows that areas formerly graded D, which were mostly inhabited by racial and ethnic minorities, have on average \textasciitilde 23\% tree canopy cover today. Areas formerly graded A, characterized by U.S.-born white populations living in newer housing stock, had nearly twice as much tree canopy (\textasciitilde 43\%). Results are consistent across small and large metropolitan regions. The ranking system used by Home Owners' Loan Corporation to assess loan risk in the 1930s parallels the rank order of average percent tree canopy cover today.}

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Urban segregation is an inherent feature of cities and becomes a problem when excluding or hindering certain groups from accessing services, activities and spaces. In Brazil, segregation by social class is dominant in the structure of cities and public policies rarely address urban configuration as part of the segregation problem. This work addresses segregation with a shift in emphasis from traditional housing segregation to segregation as the restraint of socio-spatial interactions, thus including other facets of the phenomenon that have not yet been properly explored and seeking new spatially relevant metrics. This paper aims to present a methodology of segregation analysis based on configurational models and develop an empirical application in a Brazilian city. Representing the probabilities of interaction between different socio-economic groups in public spaces, a configurational model was used, addressing retail-residence spatial relationship. The attributes of population size, household income and number of retail establishments were considered. The results allowed identifying the probabilistic residence-retail trajectories for high and low income groups, providing a first measure of spatial segregation. The conclusions seek to highlight the importance of configurational approaches for segregation studies, as well as to show potentialities and limits of this methodology.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The surprise is that, while the mean proportions of metropolitan black populations residing in such highly segregated neighborhoods decreased, the numbers of such neighborhoods actually increased in most metropolitan areas. The expansions of black neighborhoods, even as segregation decreases, pose challenges for local development and for continued racial integration.},

  abstract = {Social and urban structures are inherently complex and multidimensional. They do not arise from a single process, but from the multifaceted interplay of different social and economic processes. This is true for racial and residential/neighbourhood segregation which is the result of many factors, and its causes are not well understood. Over years, researchers have studied and measured the role and influence of different factors implicated in residential segregation, using traditional techniques and tools, mostly in social science. These include empirical studies and statistical analyses of survey and census data. Such complex and nonlinear systems are difficult to study analytically. To better understand the complexity of the social world, building a model - a smaller, less detailed and less complex version of the real world (structure, system) - is recognized as an indispensable tool. Simulation is an excellent way of modelling which results to a better understanding of social processes and features of the social world. Simulation can be used to test theories and the result of simulation will often be the development of further theory. The two most appropriate simulation modelling approaches for studying residential segregation are microsimulation and agent-based simulation. Microsimulation (Gilbert and Troitzsch 1999) is based on a large random sample of population (e.g. individuals, households, firms, etc.), treated as a unit. Transition probabilities determine the chance that units will undergo particular changes as they "age". Microsimulation is not intended as an explanatory tool, but as a means of predicting the future behaviour. Aggregate statistics can be calculated and used as estimates of the future characteristics of the population. Microsimulation does not attempt to model interaction between units, nor attempt to contain the motivations or intentions of the units. A random mechanistic process (hence its historical link to stochastic processes) takes care of the unit "aging" task. Moreover, microsimulations are developed with validation ambitions. By contrast, agent-based simulation (Gilbert and Troitzsch 1999) offers an environment of autonomous individuals (agents), where interaction between agents is permitted, and in which agents can assess information (sometimes in the light of their past experience) before taking their next action (hence its historical link to artificial intelligence). They usually do not have any validation ambitions. None of these simulation approaches alone is sufficiently good for an empirically informed model (based on census data) with validation ambitions and with the aim of exploring linkage between the social micro (e.g. household) and macro levels (e.g. social structure expressed through demographic patterns in geographical space). Therefore, on the promise of enabling such a micro-macro exploration, and to better understand the complex and dynamic world of residential segregation, where different scenarios (in light of social theories from geography and sociology) can be tested, and validated using census data, a hybrid agent-based microsimulation framework is proposed, which can be used as a test-bed for future modelling research, addressing theoretical issues in urban geography and sociology. The proposed framework offers a more comprehensive approach, where it will be possible to investigate the interaction between households, households and their environments, the relationship between attributes and behaviour of individuals and the reverse effects - the impact of social structure on individual households, and the global properties of social groups - hence, operationalising micro-macro linkages to improve understanding of residential segregation.},

Using an experiment, we show that this data-driven model can replicate plausible residential distribution and segregation patterns observed in the Auckland region (New Zealand's metropolis).

  abstract = {A very large literature has explored the intensity of urban residential segregation using the index of dissimilarity. Several recent studies have undertaken such analyses at multiple spatial scales, invariably reaching the conclusion that the finer grained the spatial scale, the greater the segregation. Such findings, however, overstate the intensity of segregation at finer spatial scales because they fail to take into account an argument made by Duncan et al. some sixty years ago that indexes derived from fine-scale analyses must necessarily incorporate those from coarser scales, with the consequence that finer scale segregation is invariably overestimated. Moreover, most studies ignore stochastic variation that results in upward bias in the estimates of segregation. This article demonstrates the importance of a recently developed multilevel modeling procedure that identifies the ``true'' intensity of segregation at every level in a spatial hierarchy net of its intensity at other levels and also net of stochastic variation This is illustrated by both a simulated data set and an empirical study of an English city, with the latter raising important substantive issues regarding the interpretation of segregation patterns and the processes underlying them.

  abstract = {Socioeconomic disparities have been rising on both sides of the Atlantic for the last forty years. This study illuminates the relationship among economic inequality, other contextual and institutional factors, and socioeconomic intraurban segregation in Eastern Europe. We draw our empirical evidence from the capital cities of so-called fast-track reforming postsocialist countries: Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, and the Czech Republic. The analysis consists of two stages. First, we use the traditional indexes of segregation to assess the global levels of socioeconomic segregation in the case cities. Second, we investigate the global patterns and local geographies of socioeconomic residential intermixing and introduce a typology of neighborhoods based on the socio-occupational composition of their residential tracts. Despite rapidly growing income inequality, the levels of socioeconomic segregation in the postsocialist city are either low or very low. The scale of segregation differs between the cities and the patterns of residential intermixing in the large cities of central and Eastern Europe are fundamentally different from those found in the Baltic states. The results lead to two important conclusions. One is that the link between socioeconomic distance and spatial distance in postsocialist cities is moderately sensitive to the level of economic inequality and to other contributory factors. The other key finding is that inertia effects have offset the immediate catalyzing effect of economic liberalization, globalization, and growing socioeconomic inequality on the patterns of segregation, at least in the first decade after the collapse of socialism.

However, these findings contradict those observed for other Hispanic groups, as well as the fundamental tenets of ecological theory. Analysis of merged 1960-1970 census tract files for New York City, NY, \& Los Angeles, Calif, SMSAs is used to explain these anomalous patterns \& to demonstrate the conformity of the Puerto Rican data conformity with prior theory \& research on residential segregation. The Puerto Rican anomaly stems from their very low SES \& their black ancestry. Low SES leads directly to high segregation, while a high \% of blacks among Puerto Ricans draws them strongly toward residence near non-Hispanic blacks. Since Anglos avoid living near blacks, Puerto Ricans become secondary victims of Anglos' racial prejudice, leading to their residential segregation in society. 6 Tables, 1 Figure, 1 Appendix, 59 References.

While these models appeared to provide an unambiguous picture of ethnic and racial segregation in citites, their estimation from ecological data posed several conceptual and statistical difficulties. This paper replicates the earlier analyses using individual-level data from the 1970 Census. Prior findings were reconfirmed, thereby validating the theory of spatial assimilation and reinforcing earlier substantive conclusions. Results also indicate that, to the extent that ecological biases affect the pattern of results, errors of substantive interpretation are conservative in nature. Thus, models estimated using census tract data for 1980 (when appropriate micro information will not be available) are not likely to yield erroneous conclusions.},

Orthogonal and oblique rotations produce pattern matrices consistent with the postulated dimensional structure.

It includes high degree of black-white segregation at the state level; influence of racial segregation patterns and levels on the nature of race relations in the country; status and well being of African Americans. Data from the decennial U.S. census are used to measure the level of black-white segregation at each geographic level using dissimilarity and isolation indexes. A long-term trend away from macro-level segregation toward micro- level segregation is documented. Whereas state-level and county-level segregation indexes fell from 1900 to 1970, neighborhood-level indexes rose. Beginning around 1950, municipal-level segregation began to increase as well, yielding a geographic pattern in which blacks and whites increasingly live in different cities as well as different neighborhoods. It was concluded that throughout the twentieth century, segregation patterns have consistently evolved to minimize white contact with blacks. The only thing that has changed is the level at which the segregation occurred.},

To reproduce their work, the authors of this article factor analyzed 20 indexes of segregation computed in 1990 for three groups in 58 metropolitan areas. They extended Massey and Denton's analysis by expanding the set of metropolitan areas to include all 318 defined for 1990, and they broadened it by carrying out systematic comparisons across ethnic groups. This study's analyses reconfirm the multidimensional nature of residential segregation; however, the authors also find that the indexes recommended by Massey and Denton to measure concentration and clustering do not function quite as well in 1990 as in 1980. Alternative indexes are considered as possibilities, but in the end, using the same indexes is recommended to maintain continuity.}

For all metropolitan areas containing at least 5000 members of the group in question, we compute indices of dissimilarity and interaction between minority members of a certain income and Whites of all income, thus measuring the extent of overall racial/ethnic segregation by social class. We find that Black residential segregation persists at high levels across all income levels, and that the gap between Blacks and other minority groups actually increases as income rises. \textcopyright{} 1999 Academic Press.},

  abstract = {High levels of black residential segregation emerged over the course of the twentieth century as the black population urbanized. Segregation was achieved by means of different mechanisms at different times and places, beginning with targeted violence directed at African Americans followed later by discrimination in real estate and banking using devices such as deed restrictions, restrictive covenants, and racial redlining, practices that were institutionalized in federal policies during the New Deal. By 1977, however, discrimination had been outlawed in most US markets and average black segregation began to decline. The declines, however, were inversely proportional to the size of the black community. As Latinos grew in number after the 1970s, levels of racial isolation within Hispanic neighborhoods also rose. At the same time, class segregation increased, especially among families with children, and inequalities of wealth and income grew to create a polarized urban geography. High concentrations of affluence now prevail for affluent whites and Asians living in wealthy post-industrial coastal areas, with high concentrations of poverty prevailing for poor blacks and Hispanics in older, declining industrial areas in the Midwest and the South, which also contain pockets of white and Asian poverty. The new political geography of race and class effectively denies blacks and Hispanics their access to quality education and undermines their lifetime earning prospects to create self-perpetuating system of social and economic stratification.},

  abstract = {Rationale Persistent racial disparities in adverse birth outcomes are not fully explained by individual-level risk factors. Racial residential segregation\textendash degree to which two or more groups live apart from one another\textendash may contribute to the etiology of these birth outcome disparities. Our aim was to assess associations between segregation and adverse birth outcomes by race. This review focused on formal measures of segregation, using Massey and Denton's framework (1998) that identifies five distinct operationalizations of segregation, in addition to proxy measures of segregation such as racial composition, in order to gain a deeper understanding of the operationalizations of segregation most salient for birth outcomes. Method Review and meta-analyses were conducted using PubMed, PsycINFO and Web of Science and included articles from inception through April 30, 2017. Results Forty-two articles examined associations between segregation and adverse birth outcomes among Black and White mothers separately. Meta-analyses showed that among Black mothers, exposure was associated with increased risk of preterm birth (OR = 1.17, 95\% CI = 1.10, 1.26), and low birth weight (OR = 1.13, 95\% CI=1.06, 1.21), and Black racial composition was associated with increased risk of preterm birth (OR = 1.20, 95\% CI=1.05, 1.37), among those living in most- compared to least-segregated neighborhoods. Few studies were conducted among White mothers and only exposure was associated with increased risk of preterm birth and low birth weight. Qualitative analyses indicated that among Black mothers, exposure and hypersegregation were associated with multiple adverse birth outcomes; findings were mixed for evenness and clustering. Conclusions and future directions Associations between segregation and adverse birth outcomes differ by race. Methodological heterogeneity between studies may obscure true associations. Research can be advanced through use of multilevel frameworks and by examining mechanistic pathways between segregation and adverse birth outcomes. Elucidation of pathways may provide opportunities to intervene to reduce seemingly intractable racial disparities in adverse birth outcomes.},

However, the most common type of job accessibility measure employed in planning practice, the cumulative opportunity measure, considers job supply but overlooks competition for jobs. Therefore, the cumulative opportunity measure may not fully capture workers' access to job opportunity. In this paper, we examine four accessibility measures, two of which account for spatial competition and the other two do not, using the Los Angeles metropolitan area as a case study. We find that measures of competitive accessibility have stronger associations with employment than non-competitive accessibility measures. We examine the relationship between residential accessibility and employment for four separate levels of educational attainment, and we find that competitive measures are especially pertinent for population segments with lower educational attainment. Therefore, we recommend competitive accessibility measures to assess the employment opportunity more accurately.}

This paper provides a comprehensive review of empirical scholarship in sociology, education, demography, and economics in order to address the question: How have five decades of growing economic inequality shaped America's social landscape? We find that growing levels of income inequality have been accompanied by increasing socioeconomic segregation across (1) friendship networks and romantic partners, (2) residential neighborhoods, (3) K-12 and university education, and (4) workplaces and the labor market. The trends documented in this review give substance to commentators' concerns: compared to the 1970s, rich and poor Americans today are less likely to know one another and to share the same social spaces.

Although a large body of research has focused on how residential mobility patterns produce segregation, little is known about how changing mobility patterns translate into temporal and scale variations in sorting. This article develops a methodological framework designed to explore how changing mobility patterns reflect such trends. It introduces a measure of sorting that reflects the extent of disparities among groups in their socio-spatial mobility. Trends in the direction and the extent of sorting can be exposed by computing sorting measures over consecutive periods. The measure is broken down to capture the relative contributions of residential mobility to sorting at hierarchically nested geographical units, for example cities and their constituent neighbourhoods. An empirical demonstration shows that changes in residential mobility patterns affect the magnitude and spatial level of residential sorting, which vary even over the short term.},

  abstract = {The spatial distribution of households of different socioeconomic groups in urban areas has drawn longstanding attention from scholars because residential location patterns have important impacts on social outcomes and the economic efficiency of cities. Recent comparative work on this topic has yielded some insight into the causes and consequences of segregation patterns, but much of this comparison is indirect. An explicitly spatial version of the entropy index has recently been developed that facilitates comparison, as it allows for the disaggregation of segregation levels by scale and income (Reardon and O'Sullivan, 2004; Reardon, 2009; Reardon and Bischoff, 2011). This paper applies these new measurement techniques to two metropolises; Hong Kong and San Francisco. Although overall segregation levels are similar, the shape of the segregation profile across geographic scales and the income distribution is quite different. The paper also includes a script for calculating spatial ordinal segregation indices in ArcGIS. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Drawing on contact theory, this study tests whether school organization affects friendship segregation in a national sample of adolescent friendship networks. The results show that friendship segregation peaks in moderately heterogeneous schools but declines at the highest heterogeneity levels. As suggested by contact theory, in schools where extracurricular activities are integrated, grades tightly bound friendship, and races mix within tracks, friendship segregation is less pronounced. The generally positive relation between heterogeneity and friendship segregation suggests that integration strategies built on concentrating minorities in large schools may accentuate friendship segregation.},

  abstract = {In the context of educational segregation by ethnic group, it has been argued that rigorous pairwise segregation comparisons over time or across space should be invariant in two situations: when the ethnic composition of the population changes while the distribution of each ethnic group over the schools remains constant (invariance 1), or when the size distribution of schools changes while the ethnic composition of each school remains constant (invariance 2). This paper makes two contributions to the segregation literature. First, it argues by means of the Mutual Information or M index, which is neither invariant 1 nor 2, that both properties have strong implications, and it provides reasons to defend that the overall segregation index need not satisfy either one. Second, nevertheless, it is shown that in pairwise comparisons this index admits two decompositions into three terms. In the first decomposition, a term is invariant 1 and also satisfies a weak version of invariance 2. In the second decomposition, a term is invariant 2 and also satisfies a weak version of invariance 1. It is shown that these decompositions can be used to reach the analogous ones obtained in Deutsch et al. (2006).},

  abstract = {Although measures of segregation are widely discussed, this paper presents a critical review of several available indices, with a special focus on their spa-tial attributes. These indices are applied to a hypothetical case, as well as to the case of Indianapolis. The results suggest that if interest is a-spatial, then traditional indices of dissimilarity are satisfactory structural measures of seg-regation over a data unit. However, if a meaningful measure of territorial segregation is desired, then an interaction-based measure appears to be the most consistent and desirable approach. Segregation is one of the most fundamental of human geographic processes, and there-fore its consistent and appropriate measurement is also important. In this brief paper, I evaluate a few of the more common measures, and propose a "geographic" variant of the most popular measure, D, the "index of dissimilarity." The knowledgeable reader will be aware not only of a fairly large and old literature on the question of the mea-surement of segregation, but of a recent, rather thorough review by Massey and Denton (1988). Nevertheless, I embark on yet another commentary, and suggest yet another variant, for two reasons: first, there is still rather universal use of the "index of dissimi-larity", D, despite well-recognized problems, especially for territorial (geographic) research; second, segregation is such a basic variable in social science-especially in geography and sociology-that it deserves our best thinking and periodic rethinking. What does segregation mean and what is it we want it to measure? Segregation refers to the spatial separation of groups, resulting from certain physical or social processes. For example, populations of plant and animal species settle in, and compete for, and come to dominate and defend, particular territories in response to conditions of the phy-sical environment, competitive characteristics of the species, etc. Humans similarly become segregated on many bases-language, religion, allegiance, class, lifestyle, and especially ethnicity and race, via processes perhaps not so different from plants and animals, but involving even more variables. Competition for space, and the varying capacity to compete, and varying moti-vations for competing are just as basic. Thus racial and ethnic segregation, for which},

We characterize two- and three-district urban structures. For high population ratios or strong intergroup interactions, only a three-district city exists. In other cases, multiplicity of equilibria arises. Both groups generally rank these equilibria differently.

Nevertheless, this paper makes an attempt to sketch the variety of ethnic and social segregation within Europe, using a large number of sources. It is shown that generally segregation levels in Europe are more moderate compared to what we can find in American cities, but these differences are not absolute.

Although the margin of error is included with aggregate estimates, it has not been incorporated into segregation indexes. With the increasing levels of diversity in small and large places throughout the United States comes a need to track accurately and study changes in racial and ethnic segregation between censuses. The 2005\textendash 2009 ACS is used to calculate three dissimilarity indexes (D) for all core-based statistical areas (CBSAs) in the United States. We introduce a simulation method for computing segregation indexes and examine them with particular regard to the size of the CBSAs. Additionally, a subset of CBSAs is used to explore how ACS indexes differ from those computed using the 2000 and 2010 censuses. Findings suggest that the precision and accuracy of D from the ACS is influenced by a number of factors, including the number of tracts and minority population size. For smaller areas, point estimates systematically overstate actual levels of segregation, and large confidence intervals lead to limited statistical power.},

  abstract = {Background: Despite being one of the wealthiest nations, disparities in adverse birth outcomes persist across racial and ethnic lines in the United States. We studied the association between historical redlining and preterm birth, low birth weight (LBW), small-for-gestational age (SGA), and perinatal mortality over a ten-year period (2006-2015) in Los Angeles, Oakland, and San Francisco, California. Methods: We used birth outcomes data from the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2015. Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) Security Maps developed in the 1930s assigned neighborhoods one of four grades that pertained to perceived investment risk of borrowers from that neighborhood: green (grade A) were considered ``Best'', blue (grade B) ``Still Desirable'', yellow (grade C) ``Definitely Declining'', and red (grade D, hence the term ``redlining'') ``Hazardous''. Geocoded residential addresses at the time of birth were superimposed on HOLC Security Maps to assign each birth a HOLC grade. We adjusted for potential confounders present at the time of Security Map creation by assigning HOLC polygons areal-weighted 1940s Census measures. We then employed propensity score matching methods to estimate the association of historical HOLC grades on current birth outcomes. Because tracts graded A had almost no propensity of receiving grade C or D and because grade B tracts had low propensity of receiving grade D, we examined birth outcomes in the three following comparisons: B vs. A, C vs. B, and D vs. C. Results: The prevalence of preterm birth, SGA and mortality tended to be higher in worse HOLC grades, while the prevalence of LBW varied across grades. Overall odds of mortality and preterm birth increased as HOLC grade worsened. Propensity score matching balanced 1940s census measures across contrasting groups. Logistic regression models revealed significantly elevated odds of preterm birth (odds ratio (OR): 1.02, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.00-1.05), and SGA (OR: 1.03, 95\% CI: 1.00-1.05) in the C vs. B comparison and significantly reduced odds of preterm birth (OR: 0.93, 95\% CI: 0.91-0.95), LBW (OR: 0.94-95\% CI: 0.92-0.97), and SGA (OR: 0.94, 95\% CI: 0.92-0.96) in the D vs. C comparison. Results differed by metropolitan area and maternal race. Conclusion: Similar to prior studies on redlining, we found that worsening HOLC grade was associated with adverse birth outcomes, although this relationship was less clear after propensity score matching and stratifying by metropolitan area. Higher odds of preterm birth and SGA in grade C versus grade B neighborhoods may be caused by higher-stress environments, racial segregation, and lack of access to resources, while lower odds of preterm birth, SGA, and LBW in grade D versus grade C neighborhoods may due to population shifts in those neighborhoods related to gentrification.},

  abstract = {Segregation has been one of the most persistent features of urban life and, accordingly, one of the main subjects of enquiry in urban studies. Stemming from a tradition that can be traced back to the Chicago School in the early twentieth century, social segregation has been seen as the natural consequence of the social division of space. Such naturalized understanding of segregation as 'territorial segregation' takes space as a surrogate for social distance. We propose a shift in the focus from the static segregation of places-where social distance is assumed rather than fully explained-to how social segregation is reproduced through embodied urban trajectories. We aim to accomplish this by exploring the spatial behaviour of different social groups as networks of movement that constitute opportunities for co-presence. This alternative view recasts the original idea of segregation as 'restrictions on interaction' by concentrating on the spatiality of segregation potentially active in the circumstances of social contact and encounters in the city. This approach to segregation as a subtle process that operates ultimately through trajectories of the body is illustrated by an empirical study in a Brazilian city.},

  abstract = {Major cities are becoming increasingly diverse, and the different aspects of diversity interact in shaping individual lives and neighbourhoods. However, existing research mainly presents the urban population living with this diversity as one group with the same overall perception of diversity. The purpose of this article is to nuance the concept of diversity through analysing the differences in urban residents' perceptions of neighbourhood diversity and the factors shaping these perceptions. The article is based on 50 qualitative interviews with residents of Bispebjerg, one of the most diverse neighbourhoods of Copenhagen, Denmark. The overall finding is that living with diversity is a diverse experience. The article identifies five ideal types of residents to demonstrate how perceptions of diversity are being shaped. They all express a positive perception of diversity on an abstract level but voice concerns regarding concrete aspects of diversity. The article identifies key factors shaping these concrete perceptions of diversity: insecurity towards ethnic diversity; social inequality; degree of socialisation to diversity; and physical and social detachment from diversity. The findings point to the importance of acknowledging differences between perceptions of diversity for different groups of residents and of addressing the different concerns of these groups.},

  abstract = {The black-white gap in low birth weight in the United States remains large and mostly unexplained. A large literature links segregation to adverse black birth outcomes but, to the best of our knowledge, no studies explore how this relationship has changed over time. We explore the relationship between racial residential segregation on black and white birth weights for the period 1970-2010. We find a negative effect of segregation on black birth outcomes that only emerges after 1980. We explore the potential pathways through which segregation influenced black birth outcomes and how these mechanisms may have changed over time. Measures for maternal socioeconomic status and behaviors accounts for 35 to 40 percent of the full segregation effect between 1990 and 2010. Single-motherhood and mother's education, and unobservable factors that load onto these variables, play important and increasing roles. After controlling for MSA and parent characteristics, segregation explains 21-25 percent of the raw black-white gap in low birth weight between 1990 and 2010.}

  abstract = {The neighbourhoods in which people live reflects their social class and preferences, so studying socio-spatial mobility between neighbourhoods gives insight in the openness of spatial class structures of societies and in the ability of people to leave disadvantaged neighbourhoods. We study the extent to which people move between different types of neighbourhoods by socio-economic status in different inequality and segregation contexts in four European countries: Sweden, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Estonia. The study is based on population registers and census data for the 2001\textendash 2011 period. For the UK, which has long had high levels of social inequalities and high levels of socio- economic segregation, we find that levels of mobility between neighbourhood types are low and opportunities to move to more socio-economically advantaged neighbourhoods are modest. In Estonia, which used to be one or the most equal and least segregated countries in Europe and now is one of the most liberal and market oriented countries, we find high levels of mobility, but these reproduce segregation patterns and it is difficult to move to better neighbourhoods for those in the most deprived neighbourhoods. In the Netherlands and Sweden, where social inequalities are the smallest, it is easiest to move from the most deprived to less deprived neighbourhoods. To conclusion, the combination of high levels of social inequalities and high levels of spatial segregation tend to lead to a vicious circle of segregation for low income groups, where it is difficult to undertake both upward social mobility and upward spatial mobility},

The spatial measures that have been proposed are often not easily computed, although there have been significant advances in the past decade. We provide a measure that is individually based (either persons or very small administrative units) and a technique for constructing neighborhoods that does not require administrative units. We show that the spatial distribution of different population groups within an urban area can be efficiently analyzed with segregation measures that use population count-based definitions of neighborhood scale. We provide a variant of a k-nearest neighbor approach and a statistic spatial isolation and a methodology (EquiPop) to map, graph, and evaluate the likelihood of individuals meeting other similar race individuals or of meeting individuals of a different ethnicity. The usefulness of this approach is demonstrated in an application of the method to data for Los Angeles and three metropolitan areas in Sweden. This comparative approach is important as we wish to show how the technique can be used across different cultural contexts. The analysis shows how the scale (very small neighborhoods, larger communities, or cities) influences the segregation outcomes. Even if microscale segregation is strong, there may still be much more mixing at macroscales.},

  abstract = {Quantitative indices of residential segregation have been with us for half a century, but suffer significant limitations. While useful for comparison among regions, summary indices fail to reveal spatial aspects of segregation. Such measures generally consider only the population mix within zones, not between them. Zone boundaries are treated as impenetrable barriers to interaction between population subgroups, so that measurement of segregation is constrained by the zoning system, which bears no necessary relation to interaction among population subgroups. A segregation measurement approach less constrained by the chosen zoning system, which enables visualization of segregation levels at the local scale and accounts for the spatial dimension of segregation, is required. We propose a kernel density estimation approach to model spatial aspects of segregation. This provides an explicitly geographical framework for modeling and visualizing local spatial segregation. The density estimation approach lends itself to development of an index of spatial segregation with the advantage of functional compatibility with the most widely used index of segregation (the dissimilarity index D). We provide a short review of the literature on measuring segregation, briefly describe the kernel density estimation method, and illustrate how the method can be used for measuring segregation. Examples using a simulated landscape and two empirical cases in Washington, DC and Philadelphia, PA are presented},

The location of assisted housing shapes where low-income assisted renters live, and it may also affect the residential choices of nonassisted residents. This article examines whether the deconcentration of assisted housing has reduced the segregation of families by income among neighborhoods in metropolitan areas from 1980 to 2005-9. I find that the deconcentration of assisted housing resulted in modest economic residential integration for very low-income families. However, high-income families became even more segregated, as assisted housing was deconcentrated, potentially offsetting the economic integration gains and ensuring that very low-income families are living in neighborhoods with only slightly higher-income neighbors. I conclude by discussing features of housing policies that might promote greater income integration among neighborhoods.},

Within large districts, between-school segregation of students who are eligible and ineligible for free lunch increased by over 40\% from 1991 to 2012. Consistent with research on neighborhood segregation, we find that rising income inequality contributed to the rise in income segregation between schools and districts during this period.

I document racial segregation between neighborhoods among school-age children and adults in 2000 and 2010 and find that though the racial composition of children's and adults' neighborhoods is similar, exposure to own-age neighbors varies. Compared with adults' exposure to other adults, children are exposed to fewer white and more minority, particularly Hispanic, children. This is due in part to compositional differences, but children are also more unevenly sorted across neighborhoods by race than adults. One explanation for higher segregation among children is that parents consider school options when making residential choices. Consistent with this hypothesis, I find that school district boundaries account for a larger proportion of neighborhood segregation among children than among adults. Future research on spatial inequality must consider the multiple contexts differentially contributing to inequality among children and adults.},

  abstract = {School and neighborhood segregation are intertwined in complex ways. Schools reflect segregated neighborhoods, and school considerations reinforce neighborhood segregation. Over the past 25~years, racial segregation in neighborhoods and schools has slightly declined in terms of sorting, though children remain racially isolated in their neighborhoods and schools. Income segregation between schools, school districts, and neighborhoods has increased among children. Recent educational policy and demographic changes may break the link between neighborhood and school segregation. As population diversity increases, the proliferation of school choice leads schools and neighborhoods to resemble one another less, with schools becoming more segregated than their local neighborhoods. Regardless of the complicated and changing ways neighborhood and school segregation shape and reshape one another, segregation in both contexts remains high in the twenty-first century. Drawing on administrative data, I provide a quantitative portrait of the schools and neighborhoods of children from different racial/ethnic groups in 2015, documenting stark inequalities in these contexts.

However, little is known about patterns of ethnic residential segregation in rapidly urbanizing African cities. This paper is crafted to make an important contribution through its focus on Ghana's two largest cities: Accra and Kumasi. Making use of the most recent population and housing census data of 2000 to generate a Location Quotient index, the analyses explore the cities' degree of ethnic diversity and concentration for comparative purposes. In relative terms, the study reveals that the level of residential ethnic segregation is fairly balanced in Accra compared to Kumasi. However, there are important dif- ferences between the findings of this Ghanaian case study and findings from research in the West, where the residential segregation is heavily determined by cultural/racial factors in addition to socio-economic factors. In the absence of institutional and ethnic discrimination, the most fundamental underlying cause of segregation in the Ghanaian case appears to be the socio-economic circumstance of ethnic groups present in the cities. The paper concludes by exploring the implications of the study for urban and national development in Ghana as well as the future patterns of ethnic clustering likely to emerge in Accra and Kumasi.},

  abstract = {Advances in mediation analysis are used to examine the legacy effects of racial residential segregation in the United States on neighborhood attainments across two familial generations. The legacy effects of segregation are anticipated to operate through two primary pathways: a neighborhood effects pathway and an urban continuity pathway. The neighborhood effects pathway explains why parent's exposure to racial residential segregation during their family-rearing years can influence the residential outcomes of their children later in life. The urban continuity pathway captures the temporal consistency of the built and topographical environment in providing similar residential opportunities across generations. Findings from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and U.S. Census data indicate that the legacy effect of racial residential segregation among black families operates primarily through the neighborhood effects that influence children growing up. For white families, there is less support for the legacy effects of segregation. The findings are supported by a comprehensive mediation analysis that provides a formal sensitivity analysis, deploys an instrumental variable, and assesses effect heterogeneity. Knowledge of the legacy of segregation moves neighborhood attainment research beyond point-in-time studies of racial residential segregation to provide a deeper understanding into the ways stratified residential environments are reproduced.},

  abstract = {This dissertation offers a new theoretical and methodological framework for understanding segregation in spatio-temporal terms as a separation of activity spaces, the spaces people move through as they go about their daily activities. The framework is a set of indexes with which multiple dimensions of activity-space segregation can be measured and com- pared across cities. The indexes are designed to capture socially relevant information about differences in the places people frequent, the people with whom they come into contact, and the nature of their movement. In designing the indexes, the dissertation extends the exist- ing areal unit indexes of residential segregation, draws on an early formulation of White's spatial proximity index, and identifies existing measures of individual activity space from the geography and ecology literature. For each index, the dissertation develops an estimator that may be used to draw inferences from sample data, and it evaluates the performance of the estimator at different sample sizes and under different geographic and demographic conditions. To do this, it relies on a combination of high resolution activity-space trajec- tories collected from volunteers all over the world through a mobile phone application, and simulated trajectories of the full populations of two U.S. cities. The dissertation concludes that the proposed areal unit measures of activity-space segregation may be estimated with minimal bias using coarse trajectory data but require large samples of people and the im- plementation of a bootstrap bias correction technique. The proposed extension of White's spatial proximity index, on the other hand, may be estimated without bias using coarse tra- jectory data from relatively small samples of people. The proposed measures of individual activity spaces require high resolution trajectory data, but may be estimated without bias using relatively small samples of people.},

  abstract = {Since the formal dismantling of apartheid in the early 1990s, the South African government has placed much emphasis on redressing the social imbalances caused by apartheid, including overcoming patterns of segregation inherent in the apartheid city. The National Development Plan, in specifying its principles for the spatial development of South African settlements, outlines the principle of spatial justice: that apartheid's policy of confining particular groups to limited spaces must be reversed. In order to inform the future success of the National Development Plan's goal of social cohesion, research into residential segregation can provide one indication of how socially integrated South African society is. The purpose of this article is to measure racial residential segregation at different geographic scales for the South African cities of Cape Town and Johannesburg, and to measure how residential segregation has changed over time using data from the population censuses of 1991, 1996, 2001 and 2011. Theil's entropy index of segregation, applied to grid squares of varying spatial sizes, is used to calculate both racial diversity and racial segregation for both cities. The results show that from 1991 to 2011, segregation levels decreased at all geographic scales in both cities. However, despite this decrease, both cities remain highly segregated. If the census enumeration area or small area is used as the base from which to calculate segregation, Cape Town as a whole is more racially segregated than Johannesburg. However, Johannesburg is more racially segregated than Cape Town at larger geographic scales.},

  abstract = {The developers of contemporary digital location-based services, like all makers of maps, commit to a series of decisions about how to portray the world. The urban neighborhood is a particularly revealing level of geographic abstraction, in part because it assumes such varied forms for different observers, lacking official boundaries in many North American cities. Simple decisions about how to represent neighborhood boundaries in software have profound consequences for how the people using these services navigate, understand, and evaluate their world. Many popular geospatial software products treat urban neighborhoods as a lattice of non-overlapping polygons covering all space. This hyper-legible view of urban space has roots in Enlightenment political rationality, the Chicago School of urban sociology, and the real estate industry. Digitally defined neighborhoods become objects of social struggle through contested boundaries, contested names, and the social effects of neighborhood scale, or the way that certain services' programmed delineations of neighborhood affect the way their products function. Popular local social network Nextdoor consists of an archipelago of self-organized, private `neighborhoods' closed to outsiders, some confined to the size of individual condominium buildings in gentrifying neighborhoods. This downscaling of community to only the most immediate neighbors has contributed to tensions around racial profiling and economic inequality in areas where large proportions of residents use these services, particularly the San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle. A patchwork of fixed polygonal borders is one of many possible ways to portray neighborhoods in code, and reflects an instrumentalist understanding of urban space already under attack by mid-20th century social science.},

In this article, we point out that the connection between the built environment and socioeconomic outcomes may be more complex than it is generally portrayed to be, particularly in light of recent trends in urban and regional development. Through an empirical analysis involving two measures of income segregation, dissimilarity and isolation, in a national data set of metropolitan areas from 1980 to 2000, we illustrate that the relationship between density and income segregation follows a quadratic function, first rising, then falling, as densities increase. Moreover, changes in density\textemdash whether increases or decreases\textemdash always increased segregation. These findings suggest that, if greater socioeconomic equity is a goal, smart growth programs need to pay as much attention to market forces and the underlying political landscape as they do to the built environment.},

  abstract = {Appreciating spatial scale is crucial for our understanding of the sociospatial context. Multiscale measures of population have been developed in the segregation and neighborhood effects literatures, which have acknowledged the role of a variety of spatial contexts for individual outcomes and intergroup contacts. Although existing studies dealing with sociospatial inequalities increasingly explore the effects of spatial scale, there has been little systematic evidence on how exposure to sociospatial contexts changes across urban space, both within and between cities. This article presents a multiscale approach to measuring potential exposure to others. Using individual-level register data for the full population of The Netherlands and an exceptionally detailed multiscalar framework of bespoke neighborhoods at 101 spatial scales, we measured the share of non-Western ethnic minorities for three Dutch cities with different urban forms. We created individual and cumulative distance profiles of ethnic exposure, mapped ethnic exposure surfaces, and applied entropy as a measure of scalar variation to compare potential exposure to others in different locations both within and between cities. The multiscale approach can be implemented for examining a variety of social processes, notably segregation and neighborhood effects.},

  abstract = {A key argument of Massey and Denton's American Apartheid (1993) is that racial residential segregation and non-white group poverty rates combine interactively to produce spatially concentrated poverty. Despite a compelling theoretical rationale, the empirical tests of this proposition have been negative or mixed. This paper develops a formal decomposition model that expands the Massey model of how segregation, group poverty rates, and other spatial conditions combine to form concentrated poverty. The revised decomposition model allows for income effects on cross-race neighborhood residence and interactive combinations of multiple spatial conditions in the formation of concentrated poverty. Applying the model to data reveals that racial segregation and income segregation within race contribute importantly to poverty concentration, as Massey argued, but that almost equally important for poverty concentration is the disproportionate poverty of the non-group neighbors of blacks and Hispanics. The missing interaction Massey expected in empirical tests can be found with proper accounting for the factors in the expanded model. "Because of racial segregation, a significant share of black America is condemned to experience a social environment where poverty and joblessness are the norm, where a majority of children are born out of wedlock, where most families are on welfare, where educational failure prevails, and where social and physical deterioration abound. Through prolonged exposure to such an environment, black chances for social and economic success are drastically reduced."--Douglas Massey and Nancy Denton, American Apartheid, p. 2.},

Our results show that this trend holds in both the national audits sponsored by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and in non-HUD studies. The decline in discrimination is strongest for discrimination that involves direct denial of housing availability, for which discrimination has declined to low levels. The downward trend in discrimination is weaker for measures reflecting the number of units recommended and inspected, and significant discrimination remains for these outcomes. In the mortgage market, we find that racial gaps in loan denial have declined only slightly, and racial gaps in mortgage cost have not declined at all, suggesting persistent racial discrimination. We discuss the implications of these trends for housing inequality, racial segregation, and racial disparities in household wealth.},

Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed test has appropriate significance levels. An example applies the methods developed in this article to test whether segregation of men and women across college majors decreased during the 1980s. The analysis finds that gender segregation has decreased, and that the decrease is statistically significant.}

  abstract = {The measurement of residential segregation patterns and trends has been limited by a reliance on segregation measures that do not appropriately take into account the spatial patterning of population distributions. In this paper we define a general approach to measuring spatial segregation among multiple population groups. This general approach allows researchers to specify any theoretically based definition of spatial proximity desired in computing segregation measures. Based on this general approach, we develop a general spatial exposure/isolation index ({\~P}*), and a set of general multigroup spatial evenness/clustering indices: a spatial information theory index ({\~H}), a spatial relative diversity index ({\~R}), and a spatial dissimilarity index ({\~D}). We review these and previously proposed spatial segregation indices against a set of eight desirable properties of spatial segregation indices. We conclude that the spatial exposure/isolation index {\~P}*\textemdash which can be interpreted as a measure of the average composition of individuals' local spatial environments\textemdash and the spatial information theory index {\~H}\textemdash which can be interpreted as a measure of the variation in the diversity of the local spatial environments of each individual\textemdash are the most conceptually and mathematically satisfactory of the proposed spatial indices.},

  abstract = {This article addresses an aspect of racial residential segregation that has been largely ignored in prior work: the issue of geographic scale. In some metropolitan areas, racial groups are segregated over large regions, with predominately white regions, predominately black regions, and so on, whereas in other areas, the separation of racial groups occurs over much shorter distances. Here we develop an approach\textemdash featuring the segregation profile and the corresponding macro/micro segregation ratio\textemdash that offers a scale-sensitive alternative to standard methodological practice for describing segregation. Using this approach, we measure and describe the geographic scale of racial segregation in the 40 largest U.S. metropolitan areas in 2000. We find considerable heterogeneity in the geographic scale of segregation patterns across both metropolitan areas and racial groups, a heterogeneity that is not evident using conventional ``aspatial'' segregation measures. Moreover, because the geographic scale of segregation is only modestly correlated with the level of segregation in our sample, we argue that geographic scale represents a distinct dimension of residential segregation. We conclude with a brief discussion of the implications of our findings for investigating the patterns, causes, and consequences of residential segregation at different geographic scales.}

  abstract = {We use newly developed methods of measuring spatial segregation across a range of spatial scales to assess changes in racial residential segregation patterns in the 100 largest U.S. metropolitan areas from 1990 to 2000. Our results point to three notable trends in segregation from 1990 to 2000: (1) Hispanic-white and Asian-white segregation levels increased at both micro- and macro-scales; (2) black-white segregation declined at a micro-scale, but was unchanged at a macro-scale; and (3) for all three racial groups and for almost all metropolitan areas, macro-scale segregation accounted for more of the total metropolitan area segregation in 2000 than in 1990. Our examination of the variation in these trends among the metropolitan areas suggests that Hispanic-white and Asian-white segregation changes have been driven largely by increases in macro-scale segregation resulting from the rapid growth of the Hispanic and Asian populations in central cities. The changes in black-white segregation, in contrast, appear to be driven by the continuation of a 30-year trend in declining micro-segregation, coupled with persistent and largely stable patterns of macro-segregation. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Several recent studies have concluded that residential segregation by income in the U.S. has increased in the decades since 1970, including a significant increase after 2000. Income segregation measures, however, are biased upwards when based on sample data. This is a potential concern because the sampling rate of the American Community Survey (ACS)-from which post-2000 income segregation estimates are constructed-was lower than that of the earlier decennial Censuses. This raises the possibility that the apparent increase in income segregation post-2000 simply reflects increased upward bias in the estimates from the ACS, and the estimated increase may therefore be inaccurate. In this paper, we first derive formulas describing the approximate sampling bias in two measures of segregation. Next, using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the bias-corrected estimators eliminate virtually all of the bias in segregation estimates in most cases of practical interest, although the correction fails to eliminate bias in some cases when the population is unevenly distributed among geographic units and the average within-unit samples are very small. We then use the bias-corrected estimators to produce unbiased estimates of the trends in income segregation over the last four decades in large U.S. metropolitan areas. Using these corrected estimates, we replicate the central analyses in four prior papers on income segregation. We find that the primary conclusions from these papers remain unchanged, although the true increase in income segregation among families after 2000 was only half as large as that reported in earlier work. Despite this revision, our replications confirm that income segregation has increased sharply among families with children in recent decades, and that income inequality is a strong and consistent predictor of income segregation.

A particular concern is computing small area trends when aggregation zone boundaries change during the trend interval. To that end, this study provides an example of dasymetric areal interpolation using the pre-classified land cover data available through the US Geological Survey's National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) program. Areal interpolation of population estimates is preferable to traditional reaggregation techniques, and the use of land cover data as a weighting factor in interpolated estimation has been shown in earlier studies to be highly accurate. In this study, the NLCD data set performs well and, because it requires no classification, it compares favorably with other land cover data sets for areal interpolation when considered on the basis of accuracy, precision and ease of use.},

The authors use innovative and robust cluster analysis techniques to classify U.S. census tracts in the 50 largest metropolitan areas. We interpret the resulting clusters according to their central tendencies and explore inter-metropolitan and regional patterns in relative cluster frequencies. Finally, we esti- mate multilevel logistic regression models of the covariates of cluster membership. We conclude that within cities, trends toward greater and potentially stable diversity in some neighborhoods co-exist with continuing White flight and re-segregation in other local areas. Further, at both the metropolitan and neighborhood levels increasing diversity is associated with the significant pres- ence of multiple minorities, while white flight and re-segregation are associated with the rapid growth of either blacks or Hispanics. This variability in transition outcomes can at least in part be attributed to demographic structure at the metropolitan scale and to the distance from established minority enclaves of the neighborhoods themselves},

  abstract = {Residential segregation is an inherently spatial phenomenon as it measures the separation of different types of people within a region. Whether measured with an explicitly spatial index, or a classic aspatial index, a region's underlying spatial properties could manifest themselves in the magnitude of measured segregation. In this paper we implement a Monte Carlo simulation approach to investigate the properties of four segregation indices in regions built with specific spatial properties. This approach allows us to control the experiment in ways that empirical data do not. In general we confirm the expected results for the indices under various spatial properties, but some unexpected results emerge. Both the Dissimilarity Index and Neighborhood Sorting Index are sensitive to region size, but their spatial counterparts, the Adjusted Dissimilarity Index and Generalized Neighborhood Sorting Index, are generally immune to this problem. The paper also lends weight to concerns about the downward pressure on measured segregation when multiple neighborhoods are grouped into a single census tract. Finally, we discuss concerns about the way space is incorporated into segregation indices since the expected value of the spatial indices tested is lower than their aspatial counterparts. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

I demonstrate the importance of this conceptual distinction with two empirical analyses: I decompose segregation and relative homogeneity in the Detroit metropolitan area, and I analyze the relationship between the indexes in the 100 largest U.S. cities. I show that it is problematic to interpret the Information Theory Index as a measure of segregation, especially when analyzing local-level results or any decomposition of overall results. Segregation and diversity are important aspects of residential differentiation, and it is critical that we study each concept as the structure and stratification of the U.S. population becomes more complex.},

However, the methods used to measure segregation do not incorporate features of the built environment, such as the road connectivity between locations or the physical barriers that divide groups. This article introduces the Spatial Proximity and Connectivity (SPC) method for measuring and analyzing segregation. The SPC method addresses the limitations of current approaches by taking into account how the physical structure of the built environment affects the proximity and connectivity of locations. In this article, I describe the method and its application for studying segregation and spatial inequality more broadly. I demonstrate one such application-analyzing the impact of physical barriers on residential segregation-with a stylized example and an empirical analysis of racial segregation in Pittsburgh, PA. The SPC method contributes to scholarship on residential segregation by capturing the effect of an important yet understudied mechanism of segregation-the connectivity, or physical barriers, between locations-on the level and spatial pattern of segregation, and enables further consideration of the role of the built environment in segregation processes.},

The negative effects of segregation are somewhat larger for Latinos than for African Americans. Controlling for Latino and white exposure to neighborhood poverty, neighbors with college degrees, and industries that saw large increases in high-skill employment explains between one half and two thirds of the association between Latino-white segregation and Latino-white gaps in outcomes.},

We suggest that segregation should be understood as an issue of mobility and co-presence in public space, rather than the static residential-based segregation that continues to be a central focus of debate in urban studies. We explore public transport infrastructures, considering how their implementation reflects the variety of ways that transport can have impact: segmenting populations, linking populations and/or creating spaces for interaction or conflict between the city's Jewish Israeli and Arab Palestinian populations. Space syntax network analysis suggests that in the case of Jerusalem, access to public transport is multi-dimensional: as well as providing access to resources, it shapes opportunities for spatial mobility that may either overcome or reinforce area-based housing segregation. We discuss these opportunities in the light of Jerusalem's on-going ethno-national division in an increasingly fractured urban reality.},

Bridges were designed to be so low that buses could not pass under them in order to prevent people of color from accessing a public beach. Walls, fences, and highways separate historically white neighborhoods from historically black ones. Wealthy communities have declined to be served by public transit so as to make it difficult for individuals from poorer areas to access their neighborhoods. Although the law has addressed the exclusionary impacts of racially restrictive covenants and zoning ordinances, most legal scholars, courts, and legislatures have given little attention to the use of these less obvious exclusionary urban design tactics. Street grid layouts, one-way streets, the absence of sidewalks and crosswalks, and other design elements can shape the demographics of a city and isolate a neighborhood from those surrounding it. In this way, the exclusionary built environment\textemdash the architecture of a place\textemdash functions as a form of regulation; it constrains the behavior of those who interact with it, often without their even realizing it. This Article suggests that there are two primary reasons that we fail to consider discriminatory exclusion through architecture in the same way that we consider functionally similar exclusion through law. First, potential challengers, courts, and lawmakers often fail to recognize architecture as a form of regulation at all, viewing it instead as functional, innocuous, and prepolitical. Second, even if decision makers and those who are excluded recognize architecture's regulatory power, existing jurisprudence is insufficient to address its harms.}

  abstract = {Areal interpolation transforms data for a variable of interest from a set of source zones to estimate the same variable's distribution over a set of target zones. One common practice has been to guide interpolation by using ancillary control zones that are related to the variable of interest's spatial distribution. This guidance typically involves using source zone data to estimate the density of the variable of interest within each control zone. This article introduces a novel approach to density estimation, the geographically weighted expectation-maximization (GWEM) algorithm, which combines features of two previously used techniques, the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and geographically weighted regression. The EM algorithm provides a framework for incorporating proper constraints on data distributions, and using geographical weighting allows estimated control-zone density ratios to vary spatially. We assess the accuracy of GWEM by applying it with land-use/land-cover ancillary data to population counts from a nationwide sample of 1980 United States census tract pairs. We find that GWEM generally is more accurate in this setting than several previously studied methods. Because target-density weighting (TDW)-using 1970 tract densities to guide interpolation-outperforms GWEM in many cases, we also consider two GWEM-TDW hybrid approaches, and find them to improve estimates substantially.}

We employ data on mobile-phone use to compare variations in segregation indices during the day, the week, and the year. The results indicate that the locations of people are more segregated at night, with considerably less segregation during the daytime. The segregation is significantly lower on workdays compared to weekends. Segregation is also lower during summer holidays compared to the winter working period. The results show that although places of residence are segregated, different ethnic groups use the city together during the day, which increases the potential for interethnic contacts. The results demonstrate also that temporal segregation indices based on mobile-phone use are considerably lower than segregation indices of places of residence that are derived from the census. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Authors.},

When this is the case, the pattern of agricultural land use is one of decreasing intensity with distance from the city. Von Th\"unen's theory still applies in underdeveloped parts of the world, but his basic premise has been outdated in more developed areas. In many advanced industrialized parts of the world, the basic forces determining agricultural land use near urban areas are associated with urban expansion. Where these forces are in operation, the agricultural pattern quite often is one of increasing intensity with distance from the city, quite the reverse of the pattern generalized by Von Th\"unen's theory. A theory is developed to explain the agricultural pattern near such modern urban areas, and empirical evidence related to this theory is examined.},

This agent based lattice model has become quite influential amongst social scientists, demographers, and economists. Aggregation relates to individuals coming together to form groups and Schelling equated global aggregation with segregation. Many authors assumed that the segregation which Schelling observed in simulations on very small cities persists for larger, realistic size cities. We describe how different measures could be used to quantify the segregation and unlock its dependence on city size, disparate neighbor comfortability threshold, and population density. We identify distinct scales of global aggregation, and show that the striking global aggregation Schelling observed is strictly a small city phenomenon. We also discover several scaling laws for the aggregation measures. Along the way we prove that as the Schelling model evolves, the total perimeter of the interface between the different agents decreases, which provides a useful analytical tool to study the evolution.

We offer six propositions from the sociology of racial discrimination that we believe economists should note. We argue that independent of taste and statistical discrimination, economists should study institutional discrimination; that institutional discrimination can take at least two forms, organizational and legal; that in both forms the decisions of a contemporary actor to discriminate can be immaterial; that institutional discrimination is a vehicle through which past discrimination has contemporary consequences; that minor forms of everyday interpersonal discrimination can be highly consequential; and that whether actors perceive they have experienced discrimination deserves attention in its own right.}

Results from hierarchical linear models show that about 20\% to 40\% of the variation in the percentage of households' tract population that is non-Hispanic white or non-Hispanic black exists across metropolitan areas. Over time, white households' exposure to non-Hispanic white neighbors has declined, and their exposure to non-Hispanic black neighbors has increased; the reverse trends are observed for blacks. These trends cannot be attributed to changes in the ecological structure of metropolitan areas. Blacks have fewer white neighbors in large metropolitan areas containing sizable minority populations, and blacks have more white neighbors in metropolitan areas with high government employment. Whites have more black neighbors in metropolitan areas with high levels of government employment and ample new housing; whites have fewer black neighbors in metropolitan areas with a high level of municipal fragmentation. The association between metropolitan-area percentage black and tract percentage black is weaker among whites than among blacks, suggesting that whites are especially motivated to self-segregate in metropolitan areas with large black populations.},

  abstract = {To what degree does the built environment of cities shape the social environment? In this article we use a Schelling-like agent-based model to consider how changes to the built environment of cities relate to changes in residential segregation by income and ethnicity. To develop this model we exploit insights from a high resolution historical GIS which maps 100\% of the population of Newark, NJ in 1880. Newark in 1880 had a complex social landscape characterized by areas of significant social and economic segrega- tion and areas of relative integration. We develop a Schelling model capable of reproducing these residen- tial patterns. We use this model to explore the decentralization of housing, a specific phenomenon associated with the demise of the walking city in the late 19th century. Holding agent preferences con- stant, but allowing the landscape of the Schelling model to evolve in ways that reflect historical changes to the built environment, produces changes to the social landscape that are also consistent with history. Our work suggests that changes in residential segregation do not necessarily imply changes to individual atti- tudes and preferences. Changes in residential segregation can be generated by changes to the built envi- ronment, specifically the geographic distribution of housing.},

  abstract = {Objectives Sociologists and other scholars have debated the causes of continuing residential segregation for several decades. Social class has been largely discounted as a substantial determinant of residential segregation by race, but recent studies have brought renewed attention to class variables. The present study reassesses the role of social class, using household income, while also considering metropolitan area characteristics. Methods This study expands on prior research by examining residential segregation between black-alone and white-alone households with 2000 decennial Census data for all U.S. Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) with at least 200,000 or more black population or 1,000,000 total population (60 MSAs total), using both spatial unevenness (dissimilarity) and two types of experiential (i.e., contextual) indicators (exposure indices), measuring socioeconomic status (SES) with a greater range and number of income levels than in past research, and using multivariate models to account for metropolitan area characteristics. Results We find that both dissimilarity and exposure measures are significantly associated with household income-black households with higher household incomes live in neighborhoods with greater exposure to whites and lower isolation from other blacks than do black households with lower incomes. Additionally, a number of MSA-level characteristics-several of which have not been considered in previous research-are substantially associated with black/white residential segregation. Conclusion We interpret these findings in the context of spatial assimilation and place stratification perspectives, and conclude that racial segregation is at least partly based on class.

In addition, racial segregation is a more important explanation of racial differences in spatial job search quality than systematic differences in social networks and job search methods, though these factors matter. Spatial job search quality has a positive and significant effect on the employment of whites and blacks, but not Latinos, and explains nearly 40 percent of the difference between white and black employment rates. These results are consistent with the existence of spatial mismatch in urban labor markets and imply that racial residential segregation limits the job opportunities of blacks, and to a lesser extent Latinos, in metropolitan areas.},

Using data from a variety of sources, including the 1990 and 2000 U.S. Census and U.S. Department of Commerce's ZIP Code Business Patterns, I control extensively for metropolitan area characteristics and other factors. In addition, I use metropolitan area physical geography characteristics as instruments for job sprawl to address the problem of simultaneity bias. I find a significant and positive effect of job sprawl on mismatch conditions faced by blacks that remains evident in the twostage least squares models but not in first difference change regressions. The crosssectional effect is particularly important in the Midwest and West, and in metropolitan areas where blacks' share of the population is large and where blacks' population growth rate is relatively low. Among others, the results also reveal that the measures of mismatch and job sprawl used in this analysis are highly correlated with blacks' employment outcomes in the expected direction},

  abstract = {Geographical and political research on urban service delivery -- who benefits and why -- has proliferated during the past two decades. Overall, this literature is not characterized by a particular attention to the importance of method in drawing conclusions about spatial equity based on empirical studies. Specifically, there has been scant interest in the effect of geographic methodology on assessing the relationship between access and socioeconomic characteristics that are spatially defined. In this paper we take a spatial analytical perspective to evaluate the importance of methodology in assessing whether or not, or to what degree the distribution of urban public services is equitable. We approach this issue by means of an empirical case study of the spatial distribution of playgrounds in Tulsa, Oklahoma, relative to that of the targeted constituencies (children) and other socioeconomic indicators. In addition to the 'traditional' measure (count of facilities in an areal unit), we consider a potential measure (based on the gravity model), average travel distance, and distance to the nearest playground as indicators of accessibility. We find significant differences between the spatial patterns in these measures that are suggested by local indicators of spatial association and other techniques of exploratory spatial data analysis. The choice of access measure not only implies a particular treatment of spatial externalities but also affects conclusions about the existence of spatial mismatch and inequity.},

Given the general disconnect between new market-rate housing in sustainable, walkable neighborhoods and affordable housing opportunities, we expect affordable housing to be located in less sustainable locations in terms of proximity to amenities, walkability, street connectivity, density, and diversity of urban form. A rich set of parcel and planning data for the city of Chicago was used to correlate sustainability indicators with the locations of both project- and tenant-based affordable housing programs. Difference-in-means tests and other descriptive statistical analysis suggest that project-based locations (with the exception of Chicago Housing Authority family units) actually score above average, especially in terms of accessibility and walkability, albeit it at the cost of concentrated poverty, racial segregation, and crime. In contrast, vouchers are located in less sustainable locations when it comes to accessibility and walkability, although they are in neighborhoods with more diversity and less poverty - and, at lower voucher concentrations, with less segregation and crime - than project units. \textcopyright{} 2011 Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.},

We conclude that on the basis of the literature reviewed, most of the intended benefits of the CWD neighborhood have been researched and found to have significant, positive effects for urban dwellers. While physical factors are but one element affecting behavior and outcomes, and the issues of self-selection and causality remain, overall, key dimensions of the CWD neighborhood have been found to positively affect social interaction, health, and safety.},

Research shows that while residential neighborhoods are becoming ethnically more diverse within cities, residential segregation from natives has overall remained persistently high. High levels of segregation are often seen as negative, preventing the integration of immigrants into their host society and having a negative impact on people's lives. Where as most studies of segregation deal with residential neighborhoods, this paper investigates segregation at workplaces for newly arrived immigrant men and women from the Global South to Sweden. By using the domain approach, we focus on the relationship between workplace segregation, residential segregation, and the ethnic composition of households. Using longitudinal register data from Sweden, we find that residential segregation is much weaker related to workplace segregation than revealed by studies using cross-sectional data. Furthermore, the residential context is not an important factor in explaining workplace segregation for immigrant men. The most important factors shaping workplace segregation pertain to economic sector and city size.},

Overall, the commute patterns of white and minority workers appear to be converging rather than diverging over time, even among low-skilled workers. Contrary to the spatial mismatch hypothesis, black and Hispanic workers living in minority areas had both shorter commutes and commutes that increased more slowly between 1977-78 and 1985 compared to workers in other areas. Further, a longitudinal analysis shows that the average commute times of non-moving minority workers in predominantly minority areas decreased during the study period.

Additionally, in the most recent year of analysis, residents were increasingly stratified by race in different school districts. Segregation patterns differ substantially, however, depending on the history of secession in the county.},

New trends, notably the emergence of hypersegregation and rising segregation levels in several places, call into question earlier views about the inevitability of Hispanics' spatial assimilation, as do studies that examine direct links between individual mobility and locational attainment. The growing support for the tenets of the place stratification model suggests that Hispanic origin is becoming a racial marker. Following a brief review of social and economic correlates of Hispanics' residential makeover, we conclude by discussing opportunities for future research, emphasizing the importance of dynamic assessments that consider the new contours of racialization in the context of multiethnic places. \textcopyright{} Copyright \textcopyright 2014 by Annual Reviews.

The analysis focuses on the effects of racial residential segregation on mortality and infection rates for the overall population and on racial and ethnic mortality gaps. To account for potential confounding, I assemble a dataset that includes 50 county-level factors that are potentially related to residential segregation and COVID-19 infection and mortality rates. These factors are grouped into eight categories: demographics, density and potential for public interaction, social capital, health risk factors, capacity of the health care system, air pollution, employment in essential businesses, and political views. I use double-lasso regression, a machine learning method for model selection and inference, to select the most important controls in a statistically principled manner. Counties that are 1 SD above the racial segregation mean have experienced mortality and infection rates that are 8\% and 5\% higher than the mean. These differences represent an average of four additional deaths and 105 additional infections for each 100,000 residents in the county. The analysis of mortality gaps shows that, in counties that are 1 SD above the Black\textendash White segregation mean, the Black mortality rate is 8\% higher than the White mortality rate. Sensitivity analyses show that an unmeasured confounder that would overturn these findings is outside the range of plausible covariates.},

  abstract = {The term segregation has a strong connotation with residential neighbourhoods, and most studies investigating ethnic segregation focus on the urban mosaic of ethnic concentrations in residential neighbourhoods. However, there is now a small, but growing, literature, which focusses on segregation in other domains of daily life where inter-ethnic encounters and social interaction might take place, such as: workplaces; family/partner relationship; leisure time; education; transport, and virtual domains such as social media. The focus on residential segregation is understandable. Ethnic residential segregation is easily visible in cities as segregated neighbourhoods often have their own distinct identity and reputation. Residential segregation is also relatively easy to investigate by using register or census data on where different ethnic groups live. However, if the interest in segregation stems from the idea that we want to measure the integration of ethnic minorities in society, and from an interest in social interaction between ethnic groups, then just investigating where people live is far too limited and other domains such as workplaces should be taken into account. In this paper we present an integrated conceptual framework of ethnic segregation in different life domains in which we combine elements from the life course approach and from time geography.},

  abstract = {Studies of racial residential segregation have found that black-white segregation in U.S. metropolitan areas has declined slowly but steadily since the early 1970s. As of this writing, black-white residential segregation in the United States is approximately 25 \% lower than it was in 1970. To identify the sources of this decline, we used individual-level, geocoded data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to compare the residen-tial attainment of different cohorts of blacks. We analyzed these data using Blinder-Oaxaca regression decomposition techniques that partition the decline in residential segregation among cohorts into the decline resulting from (1) changes in the social and economic characteristics of blacks and (2) changes in the association between blacks' social and economic characteristics and the level of residential segregation they experience. Our findings show that black cohorts entering adulthood prior to the civil rights movement of the 1960s experienced consistently high levels of residential segregation at middle age, but that cohorts transitioning to adulthood during and after this period of racial progress experienced significantly lower levels of residential segregation. We find that the decline in black-white residential segregation for these later cohorts reflects both their greater social},

While these measures provide a quick means of comparing segregation patterns across space and time, they are not linked to the processes that generate and maintain segregative patterns. This paper proposes a new method for measuring segregation. The method is based on comparative evaluations of neighbourhood characteristics as a determinant of spatial behaviour in cities. The proposed approach moves away from a purely geometric interpretation of segregation by anchoring the measurement of segregation into the actual urban setting. The method's main advantages are its responsiveness to changes in urban characteristics (e.g. spatial variations in rent increases), and changes in preference structures (e.g. a declining importance of distance as an impediment to relocation). A numerical example is used to demonstrate the behaviour of the proposed method against traditional segregation measures. The results indicate that the segregation experiences of minorities may be more severe than previously thought. \textcopyright{} 1993, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, an ideal Pigovian regulatory intervention is emulated and added into Schelling's (1971) classic spatial proximity model of racial segregation, with an aim to preserve collective welfare against the negative externalities induced by the changing local racial compositions after individual relocations. A key discovery from a large number of cellular automata is that the Pigovian regulation tends to result in less segregated but also less efficient (in terms of aggregate utility) residential patterns than laissez faire. This finding, albeit from a highly stylized model, bears intellectual relations to an important practical question: What are the potential racial effects of Pigovian local planning interventions, such as financially motivated anti-density zoning or the collection of a development impact fee? On top of its modest policy implications, this paper demonstrates a bottom-up computational modelling approach to reconcile the preference-based and institution-orientated academic perspectives regarding racial residential segregation.},

This paper aims to help fill in this gap by contributing an empirical study in Hong Kong. We compare the daily life experiences of public and private housing residents in terms of activity space and exposure to people in their daily life. We find that inhabitants of public housing in Hong Kong are disadvantaged in many ways. Public housing residents' lower socio-economic status, smaller homes, and lower car ownership distinguish them from inhabitants of private housing. We also find that the activity spaces of these residents are not necessarily smaller than those of private housing residents. Public housing residents in fact have more extensive activity spaces and spend more time out of the home. However, their activity spaces are socio-economically different from those of private housing residents. They are more likely exposed to people similar to themselves than private housing residents. This study offers some important empirical evidence on activity\textendash space segregation as well as improves the understanding about socio-spatial distance between public and private housing residents of Hong Kong.},

We analyze 650 million geocoded Twitter messages to estimate the home locations and travel patterns of almost 400,000 residents over 18 mo. We find surprisingly high consistency across neighborhoods of different race and income characteristics in the average travel distance (radius) and number of neighborhoods traveled to (spread) in the metropolitan region; however, we uncover notable differences in the composition of the neighborhoods visited. Residents of primarily black and Hispanic neighborhoods-whether poor or not-are far less exposed to either nonpoor or white middle-class neighborhoods than residents of primarily white neighborhoods. These large racial differences are notable given recent declines in segregation and the increasing diversity of American cities. We also find that white poor neighborhoods are substantially isolated from nonpoor white neighborhoods. The results suggest that even though residents of disadvantaged neighborhoods travel far and wide, their relative isolation and segregation persist.},

This paper examines this hypothesis using data covering more than 160000 block groups within 359 US metropolitan areas over the years 1980, 1990, and 2000. The findings indicate that income inequality - defined by the variance of the log household income distribution - does indeed rise significantly as urban density declines. This increase, however, is associated with rising inequality within block groups as cities spread out. The extent of income variation exhibited between different block groups, by contrast, shows virtually no association with population density. There is, accordingly, little evidence that sprawl is systematically associated with greater residential segregation of households by income.},

  abstract = {Urban research has increasingly acknowledged the significance of the social and spatial composition of schools in the broader socio-spatial dynamics of cities overall. With increasingly marketised education systems, parental choice of school is a key mechanism affecting wider urban processes such as gentrification. Most research into school choice in cities concentrates on the dynamics of choice (how and what parents say they choose). Fewer studies deal with the relationship between choice and the subsequent allocation of pupils to schools. This paper reports the findings of an international systematic review of the connections between parental choice and pupil allocation in school choice systems across the globe. We find that school choice is associated with higher levels of segregation of pupils from different socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds between schools. This finding is consistent across all types of choice mechanism, in different countries and cities, and across choice systems that have been in place for different lengths of time. The reasons behind the observed relationship are, however, highly localised and contextual, including particularities of the choice mechanism, social composition of neighbourhoods and mix of school types in a city. Increases in between-school segregation may lead to schools being more homogeneous in their social composition, with broader implications for social cohesion and educational inequalities in cities. Relating the findings to the broader urban school literatures, we suggest that scales and geographies of allocation are critical in understanding the dilemmas and dynamics of choice, the resultant inequalities, and any proposed interventions or solutions to reduce these inequalities.},

  abstract = {Clustering is a central concern in geographic data science and reflects a large, active domain of research. In spatial clustering, it is often challenging to balance two kinds of `goodness of fit:' clusters should have `feature' homogeneity, in that they aim to represent one `type' of observation, and also `geographic' coherence, in that they aim to represent some detected geographical `place'. This divides `map typologization' studies, common in geodemographics, from `regionalization' studies, common in spatial optimization and statistics. Recent attempts to simultaneously typologize and regionalize data into clusters with both feature homogeneity and geographic coherence have faced conceptual and computational challenges. Fortunately, new work on spectral clustering can address both regionalization and typologization tasks within the same framework. This research develops a novel kernel combination method for use within spectral clustering that allows analysts to blend smoothly between feature homogeneity and geographic coherence. I explore the formal properties of two kernel combination methods and recommend multiplicative kernel combination with spectral clustering. Altogether, spatially encouraged spectral clustering is shown as a novel kernel combination clustering method that can address both regionalization and typologization tasks in order to reveal the geographies latent in spatially structured data.},

A major finding is that if people of the same ethnic groups are positively spatially autocorrelated, increasing the size of areal units of analysis may not lower D initially, because only people of the same group are added. But enlarging the areal units subsequently may include population of other ethnic groups, and therefore could lower D. However, if the boundaries of the larger enumeration units are drawn to include only population of the same group, then D will not change significantly. Both the spatial autocorrelation of ethnic group population and zonal pattern are critical factors in determining the scale sensitivity of D.},

By randomly placing the lattice, we can study the zoning effect. This methodology links the MAUP effects to specific scale reflected by the size of grids. We use this method to study the MAUP effects on the segregation index D. Among the thirty selected cities in the USA, values of D respond to the MAUP in a diverse pattern.

Several spatial measures have been suggested to measure spatial segregation, but whether they are more or less sensitive to changes in spatial scale has not been investigated, while some spatial measures are relatively scale-insensitive. Using the 1990 Census data of 30 selected U.S. metropolitan areas, this paper demonstrates that these spatial measures, similar to the aspatial measure, report higher levels of segregation when smaller areal units are used in the analysis. Some spatial measures are even more sensitive to scale changes than aspatial measures. Certain patterns of the scale sensitivity were identified, but no general rules can be formulated.

  abstract = {While the literature clearly acknowledges that individuals may experience different levels of segregation across their various socio-geographical spaces, most measures of segregation are intended to be used in the residential space. Using spatially aggregated data to evaluate segregation in the residential space has been the norm and thus individual's segregation experiences in other socio-geographical spaces are often de-emphasized or ignored. This paper attempts to provide a more comprehensive approach in evaluating segregation beyond the residential space. The entire activity spaces of individuals are taken into account with individuals serving as the building blocks of the analysis. The measurement principle is based upon the exposure dimension of segregation. The proposed measure reflects the exposure of individuals of a referenced group in a neighborhood to the populations of other groups that are found within the activity spaces of individuals in the referenced group. Using the travel diary data collected from the tri-county area in southeast Florida and the imputed racial-ethnic data, this paper demonstrates how the proposed segregation measurement approach goes beyond just measuring population distribution patterns in the residential space and can provide a more comprehensive evaluation of segregation by considering various socio-geographical spaces.},

  abstract = {Recent discussions of the 'geography of gentrification' highlight the need for comparative analysis of the nature and consequences of inner-city transformation. In this paper, the authors map the effects of housing-market and policy changes in the 1990s, focusing on 23 large cities in the USA. Using evidence from field surveys and a mortgage-lending database, they measure the class selectivity of gentrification and its relation to processes of racial and ethnic discrimination. They find a strong resurgence of capital investment in the urban core, along with magnified class segregation. The boom of the 1990s and policies targeted towards 'new markets' narrowed certain types of racial and ethnic disparities in urban credit markets, but there is evidence of intensified discrimination and exclusion in gentrified neighborhoods.}

We reinterpret past survey data on whites' attitudes about desired neighborhoods as revealing large heterogeneity in whites' tolerance of black neighbors. Through agent-based modeling, we improve on a previous model of residential racial segregation by introducing individual-level heterogeneity in racial tolerance. Our model predicts, in the long run, a lower level of residential racial segregation than would be true with homogeneous racial tolerance. Further analysis shows that whites' tolerance of black neighbors is closely associated with their overall racial attitudes toward blacks.},

  abstract = {Previous research on segregation and health has been criticized for overlooking the fact that segregation is a multi-dimensional concept (i.e., evenness, exposure, concentration, centralization, and clustering) and recent evidence drawn from non-black minorities challenges the conventional belief that residential segregation widens racial health disparities. Combining a survey data (n = 18,752) from Philadelphia with the 2010 Census tract (n = 925) data, we examine two theoretical frameworks to understand why the association of segregation with health may differ by race/ethnicity. Specifically, we investigate how each dimension of segregation contributed to racial disparities in self-rated health. We found (1) high levels of white/black concentration could exacerbate the white/black health disparities up to 25 percent, (2) the white/Hispanic health disparities was narrowed by increasing the level of white/Hispanic centralization, and (3) no single dimension of segregation statistically outperforms others. Our findings supported that segregation is bad for blacks but may be beneficial for Hispanics.},

  abstract = {Race and class factors have been studied as underlying causes of segregation for many years. Individual choices on race and economic constraints of living in one area versus another play an important role in residential segregation. An attempt has not yet been made to simulate the interplay of neighbourhood racial and economic composition in forming segregation using empirical micro-level data. Using City of Buffalo data, this study explores how individuals' housing location choices with respect to racial composition and housing sale prices in their neighbourhoods can give rise to aggregate patterns of residential segregation and how segregation at one point in time was contributing to increased segregation at later stages. The results show that observed patterns of segregation in the city could plausibly arise from the interaction of racial and economic factors. This study also demonstrates the application of such models on exploring the possible effects of proposed integration efforts.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a Schelling-type checkerboard model of residential segregation formulated as a spatial game. It shows that although every agent prefers to live in a mixed-race neighborhood, complete segregation is observed almost all of the time. A concept of tipping is rigorously defined, which is crucial for understanding the dynamics of segregation. Complete segregation emerges and persists in the checkerboard model precisely because tipping is less likely to occur to such residential patterns. Agent-based simulations are used to illustrate how an integrated residential area is tipped into complete segregation and why this process is irreversible. This model incorporates insights from Schelling's two classical models of segregation (the checkerboard model and the neighborhood tipping model) and puts them on a rigorous footing. It helps us better understand the persistence of residential segregation in urban America. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract = {Neighborhoods where blacks and whites live in integrated settings alongside Hispanics and Asians represent a new phenomenon in the United States. These ``global neighborhoods'' have previously been identified in the nation's most diverse metropolitan centers. This study examines the full range of metropolitan areas to ask whether similar processes are occurring in other parts of the country. Is there evidence of stable racial integration in places that lack such diversity? What are the paths of neighborhood change in areas with few Hispanic or Asian residents, or areas where Hispanics are the principal minority group, or where there is no large minority presence at all? We distinguish four types of metropolitan regions: white, white/black, white/Hispanic/Asian, and multiethnic. These regions necessarily differ greatly in neighborhood composition, but some similar trajectories of neighborhood change are found in all of them. The results provide new evidence of the effect of Hispanic and Asian presence on black-white segregation in all parts of the country.},
