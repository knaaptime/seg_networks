## Metropolitan Travel Infrastructure as a Network Graph

The travel infrastructure in a metropolitan region serves as its skeleton for both urban development
and social interactions. For decades, scholars have worked to quantify the aspects of urban form
that help explain behaviors such as travel mode choice [@crane2000InfluenceUrban;@clifton2008QuantitativeAnalysis;@ewing2009MeasuringUnmeasurable@ewing2010TravelBuilt]. A recent evolution of
this work is the conception of a travel network as a formal graph structure
[@boeing2018PlanarityStreet;@boeing2018MorphologyCircuity;@fleischmann2021MethodologicalFoundation;@fleischmann2018MeasuringUrban],
and a set of software tools that facilitate its analysis
[@boeing2016OSMnxNew;@fleischmann2019MomepyUrban].

## Measuring Graph Structure

We use OSMNx and Momepy to create measures of the pedestrian travel network collected from
OpenStreetMap.

## Graph Topology and Segregation Differences

To understand how urban design decisions such as the topology of the
travel network may impact the ability for residents to interact (as
measured by the segregation index), we begin with an exploration of
the correlates of the differences in these segregation measures and
network structure.
