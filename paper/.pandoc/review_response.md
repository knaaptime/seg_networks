# Response to the reviewers

**General intro text goes here**
We thank the reviewers for their critical assessment of our work.
In the following we address their concerns point by point.

## Reviewer: 1

::: {.rev1} :::
Overall this is a well written and interesting review; although there are some areas of improvement that would strengthen the contribution. I would like to see the authors engage with Q, R, and S and lengthen their discussion of T
::::::::::::::::

We thank the reviewer for the positive review of our work. We agree with critiques and Q and R aand have responded in this way...

We argue, however, that the reviewer's misunderstands our intention behind S and we have added a clarifying paragraph in the manuscript.


## Reviewer: 2

::: {.rev2} :::
This paper is garbage and should be lit on fire. It fails to cite me and my colleagues in our seminal papers and it doesnt describe my greatness thoroughly. The authors should lose their credentials
:::::::::::

We appreciate this critique from the reviewer, though we respectfully disagree with the assessment. The argument we make in this paper is X, although we respect the reviewer's alternative perspective. We have added the requested citations and believe we should keep our credentials. 


## Reviewer: 3

::: {.rev3} :::
This paper is both good and bad. It needs major revisions A, B, and C
:::::::::::::::::::

We thank the reviewer for this feedback and we have addressed A, B, and C through X, Y, and Z
