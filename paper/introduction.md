First, we aim to understand the implications of simple Euclidean distance- based abstractions when
conducting formal spatial analyses; that is, do we find substantive differences in results when more
realistic concepts of spatial relationships (e.g. network connectivity) are considered? Second, we
aim to explore the elements of urban design (particularly the street network configuration) in
widening the gap between analytical abstraction and empirical reality. More simply, we aim to
understand whether certain elements of the street network are associated with a greater difference
in measured segregation. With this knowledge, urban designers and planners can begin with more
