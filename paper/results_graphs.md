Our two-value test is doing a good job (i.e., it is picking up a difference)

The ps_inter is an interaction term between the planar_measure and whether the two-value test was significant. This tells us that the slope is larger for those cities where the difference in the two-value test is significant.

The pct difference generally declines with the overall level of segregation and network size (as measured by street_length) althoug the latter association appears to be driven by the places with the significant two-value tests
